Let's implement the puzzle that involves recoloring a target object based on the color of a guide object:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# recolor, guide object, connected components

# description:
# Input consists of a grid with at least two distinct objects: a target object and a guide object.
# Identify the target object and change its color to match the color of the guide object.
# The guide object is distinct and serves as the reference for the new color.
# All other grid elements remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Detect all objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)

    # Assume the last object is the guide object
    guide_object = objects[-1]

    # Determine the color of the guide object
    guide_color = np.unique(guide_object[guide_object != Color.BLACK])[0]

    # Assume the first object is the target object
    target_object = objects[0]

    # Change the color of the target object to match the guide object
    target_object[target_object != Color.BLACK] = guide_color

    # Create an output grid, initially a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Place the recolored target object back into the grid
    output_grid = blit_object(output_grid, target_object, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of size 10x10
    grid = np.full((10, 10), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a target object with a random color
    target_color = random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    target_object = random_sprite(3, 3, color_palette=[target_color], connectivity=8)

    # Generate a guide object with a different random color
    guide_color = random.choice([c for c in Color.NOT_BLACK if c != target_color])
    guide_object = random_sprite(2, 2, color_palette=[guide_color], connectivity=8)

    # Place the target object randomly in the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, target_object, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, target_object, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Place the guide object randomly in the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
- **Concepts**: This puzzle involves recognizing connected components, identifying a target object and a guide object, and recoloring the target object based on the guide object's color.
  
- **Main Function**:
  - Detects all monochromatic connected components (objects) in the input grid.
  - Assumes the first detected object is the target and the last is the guide.
  - Changes the color of the target object to match the guide object's color.
  - Places the recolored target object back into the output grid.

- **Generate Input Function**:
  - Creates a 10x10 grid.
  - Generates a target object and a guide object with distinct random colors.
  - Randomly places these objects into the grid, ensuring they don't overlap.

This puzzle challenges students to understand the manipulation of objects based on connected components and color transformations.
