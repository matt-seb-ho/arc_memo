Let's implement the puzzle based on the provided description:

1. **Concepts**: Line drawing, pixel connectivity, grid update.
2. **Description**: Given a grid with two distinct pixels marked as start and end, draw a straight line connecting these two pixels using a specified color. The line is drawn using pixel connectivity, updating the grid by coloring each pixel along the path with the given color. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

Here is the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# line drawing, pixel connectivity, grid update

# description:
# Given a grid with two distinct pixels marked as start and end, draw a straight line connecting these two pixels using a specified color.
# The line is drawn using pixel connectivity, updating the grid by coloring each pixel along the path with the given color. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Copy the input grid to output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Get start and end positions
    start_pos = np.argwhere((input_grid != Color.BLACK) & (input_grid != Color.RED))
    start_x, start_y = start_pos[0]

    end_pos = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.RED)
    end_x, end_y = end_pos[0]

    # Determine the color for the line
    line_color = input_grid[start_x, start_y]

    # Draw a line from start to end using Bresenham's line algorithm
    def bresenham(x0, y0, x1, y1):
        dx = abs(x1 - x0)
        dy = abs(y1 - y0)
        sx = 1 if x0 < x1 else -1
        sy = 1 if y0 < y1 else -1
        err = dx - dy

        while True:
            output_grid[x0, y0] = line_color
            if x0 == x1 and y0 == y1:
                break
            e2 = 2 * err
            if e2 > -dy:
                err -= dy
                x0 += sx
            if e2 < dx:
                err += dx
                y0 += sy

    # Draw the line
    bresenham(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a random grid size
    n, m = np.random.randint(8, 12), np.random.randint(8, 12)
    grid = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)

    # Choose a random color for the line
    line_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))

    # Randomly place the start pixel
    start_x, start_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    grid[start_x, start_y] = line_color

    # Randomly place the end pixel (red) ensuring it's not the same as the start
    end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    while end_x == start_x and end_y == start_y:
        end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    grid[end_x, end_y] = Color.RED

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
- **`main` function**:
  - Copies the input grid to prevent modifications on the original data.
  - Identifies the start and end pixels based on their colors using `np.argwhere`.
  - Uses Bresenham's line algorithm to draw a straight line between the start and end points, coloring the path with the specified line color.

- **`generate_input` function**:
  - Creates a random-sized grid and places a random line color at a start position.
  - Selects a random end position marked with a red color, ensuring it's not the same as the start position.
