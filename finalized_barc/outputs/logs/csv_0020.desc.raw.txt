# concepts: grid partitioning, separator detection, slicing
# description: Input is a grid containing full-length separator rows or columns of a single color that divide the grid into distinct regions. Identify these separators and use them to partition the grid into contiguous sub-grids. Each sub-grid is formed by slicing the input grid between consecutive separators, excluding the separators themselves. The output is a list of these sub-grids, preserving their original order and content.
