Certainly! Let's design a puzzle based on the description provided. The goal is to match a generated boolean mask from a 3x3 grid with a given pattern_mask without allowing any transformations like rotations or flips.

Here's how the implementation would look:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# pattern matching, boolean mask, predicate evaluation, exact match

# description:
# You are given a 3x3 grid (window) of colors and a boolean mask (pattern_mask) of the same size.
# A predicate function is applied to each cell in the window to create a boolean mask.
# Return a 1x1 grid with a green pixel if the generated mask matches the given pattern_mask exactly.
# Otherwise, return a 1x1 grid with a red pixel. No rotations or flips are allowed in matching.

def main(input_data: Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]) -> np.ndarray:
    window, pattern_mask = input_data
    # Define a predicate function; for example, check if the color is not black
    predicate = lambda color: color != Color.BLACK
    
    # Create a boolean mask by applying the predicate to each cell in the window
    generated_mask = np.vectorize(predicate)(window)
    
    # Check if the generated mask matches the pattern_mask exactly
    if np.array_equal(generated_mask, pattern_mask):
        # If they match, return a 1x1 grid with a green pixel
        return np.full((1,1), Color.GREEN)
    else:
        # Otherwise, return a 1x1 grid with a red pixel
        return np.full((1,1), Color.RED)

def generate_input() -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    # Generate a 3x3 grid with random colors
    window = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), size=(3, 3))
    
    # Generate a random boolean pattern mask
    pattern_mask = np.random.choice([True, False], size=(3, 3))
    
    return window, pattern_mask
```

### Explanation:

- **Main Function**: 
  - We receive a tuple of a 3x3 grid (`window`) and a boolean mask (`pattern_mask`).
  - A predicate function is used to evaluate each color in the grid. For simplicity, I've used a predicate that checks if the color is not black.
  - We apply this predicate to generate a boolean mask from the grid.
  - The generated boolean mask is then compared to the pattern_mask using `np.array_equal`.
  - If they match, we return a 1x1 grid with a green pixel. Otherwise, a red pixel.

- **Generate Input Function**:
  - We generate random colors for the 3x3 grid.
  - A random boolean mask is generated as the `pattern_mask`.
  - Both the grid and the mask are returned as a tuple to be used as input to the `main` function.

This puzzle teaches students about pattern matching and boolean logic, as they must determine how to create a matching boolean mask from a color grid using a given predicate.
