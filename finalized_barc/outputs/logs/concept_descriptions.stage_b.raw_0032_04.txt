Let's implement the described puzzle involving L-shape detection on a 2x2 grid. We'll focus on identifying which corner is unoccupied by the L-shape and output the orientation as "tl", "tr", "bl", or "br".

Here's the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# L-shape detection, corner identification, orientation classification

# description:
# The input is a 2x2 grid containing a dominant L-shaped triomino (3 pixels).
# The grid has noise, but the L-shape is clearly discernible.
# Identify which of the four corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) is unoccupied by the L-shape.
# Output the orientation as one of "tl", "tr", "bl", or "br" corresponding to the missing corner.

def main(input_grid):
    # Count the number of non-black pixels in each corner
    top_left = input_grid[0, 0] != Color.BLACK
    top_right = input_grid[0, 1] != Color.BLACK
    bottom_left = input_grid[1, 0] != Color.BLACK
    bottom_right = input_grid[1, 1] != Color.BLACK
    
    # Use the pattern of occupied corners to determine the missing corner
    if not top_left:
        return np.array([["tl"]], dtype=object)
    elif not top_right:
        return np.array([["tr"]], dtype=object)
    elif not bottom_left:
        return np.array([["bl"]], dtype=object)
    elif not bottom_right:
        return np.array([["br"]], dtype=object)

def generate_input():
    # Create a 2x2 grid with an L-shaped triomino
    grid = np.full((2, 2), Color.BLACK, dtype=int)
    
    # Choose which corner will be missing (i.e., not part of the L-shape)
    missing_corner = np.random.choice(["tl", "tr", "bl", "br"])
    
    # Fill the L-shape into the grid based on the missing corner
    if missing_corner != "tl":
        grid[0, 0] = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    if missing_corner != "tr":
        grid[0, 1] = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    if missing_corner != "bl":
        grid[1, 0] = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    if missing_corner != "br":
        grid[1, 1] = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    # Introduce some noise by randomly changing one cell to another color
    # if there is a free cell to introduce noise
    if missing_corner == "tl":
        grid[1, 1] = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    elif missing_corner == "tr":
        grid[1, 0] = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    elif missing_corner == "bl":
        grid[0, 1] = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    elif missing_corner == "br":
        grid[0, 0] = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    return grid
```

In this implementation:
- `main` identifies the unoccupied corner by checking which corner has a `Color.BLACK` value.
- `generate_input` creates a 2x2 grid with one corner left as `Color.BLACK` and the other three filled with random colors.
- Noise is introduced by coloring a normally unoccupied cell when possible, ensuring the L-shape remains dominant.
