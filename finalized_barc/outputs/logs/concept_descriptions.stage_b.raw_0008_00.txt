Here is the implementation of the new puzzle based on the provided description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# recolor, connected components, color scheme

# description:
# The input consists of a grid with various colored objects.
# To create the output, identify a single connected component (object) within the grid.
# Apply a given color scheme to recolor the entire object.
# The color scheme may be a single color or a function that determines the color based on object properties.
# All other grid elements remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Detect all connected components in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=4, monochromatic=True)

    # Choose a single object to transform (for simplicity, choose the largest one)
    largest_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))

    # Define a color scheme; for simplicity, choose to recolor with a random color from the palette
    new_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))

    # Apply the color scheme to the chosen object
    largest_object[largest_object != Color.BLACK] = new_color

    # Create the output grid by blitting back all objects
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    blit_object(output_grid, largest_object, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of size 10x10 with random colored objects
    grid_size = 10
    input_grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate random objects and place them in the grid
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)  # Random number of objects
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        obj = random_sprite(n=[2, 3, 4], m=[2, 3, 4], color_palette=[Color.RED, Color.BLUE, Color.GREEN, Color.YELLOW])
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(input_grid, obj, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(input_grid, obj, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
        except ValueError:
            continue

    return input_grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **Concepts**: This puzzle focuses on identifying connected components in a grid and applying a color scheme to transform one of them. The transformation involves recoloring the largest object detected.

2. **Main Function**: 
   - Detects all connected components in the input grid.
   - Selects the largest connected component.
   - Applies a new color to the selected object using a color scheme (a random color from the available palette).
   - Outputs the transformed grid with the recolored object.

3. **Generate Input**:
   - Creates a 10x10 grid filled with black (representing the background).
   - Randomly generates and places colored objects (sprites) on the grid.
   - Ensures that the input grid contains several randomly sized and colored objects.

This puzzle encourages students to understand connected components and the application of deterministic transformations based on object properties.
