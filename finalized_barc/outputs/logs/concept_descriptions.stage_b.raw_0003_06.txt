Certainly! Let's design a puzzle based on the given description about determining the output grid's shape using a guide object's bounding box.

### Concepts:
- Output grid shape
- Guide object
- Bounding box
- Zero-initialized grid

### Description:
In the input grid, you will see several randomly placed colored objects on a black background. Among these objects, one will be uniquely marked with a distinct color not used by any other object. This special object is the "guide object."

To create the output grid, first determine the guide object's bounding box. The output grid should have dimensions equal to this bounding box, and it should be initialized with the background color (black). Finally, copy the guide object into this output grid at its corresponding position, cropping out any excess background.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# output grid shape, guide object, bounding box, zero-initialized grid

# description:
# In the input grid, you will see multiple colored objects on a black background. One object is marked with a unique color that no other object has. This is the guide object.
# To make the output, determine the bounding box of this guide object. The output grid should match the dimensions of this bounding box and be initialized with a black background.
# Copy the guide object into this output grid at its corresponding position.

def main(input_grid):
    # Plan:
    # 1. Identify the guide object based on its unique color.
    # 2. Determine the bounding box of the guide object.
    # 3. Create an output grid with dimensions equal to the bounding box, initialized with black.
    # 4. Place the guide object into this output grid.

    # Step 1: Identify the guide object
    unique_colors = set(np.unique(input_grid)) - {Color.BLACK}
    color_counts = {color: np.sum(input_grid == color) for color in unique_colors}
    guide_color = min(color_counts, key=color_counts.get)
    
    # Step 2: Determine the bounding box of the guide object
    guide_object = np.where(input_grid == guide_color, guide_color, Color.BLACK)
    bounding_box = crop(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)
    bounding_box_shape = bounding_box.shape
    
    # Step 3: Create an output grid with dimensions equal to the bounding box
    output_grid = np.full(bounding_box_shape, Color.BLACK, dtype=int)
    
    # Step 4: Copy the guide object into this output grid
    output_grid = bounding_box

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with several colored objects
    n, m = np.random.randint(15, 20, size=2)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK, dtype=int)

    # Generate random objects
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        obj_color = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)
        obj_width, obj_height = np.random.randint(2, 5, size=2)
        sprite = random_sprite(obj_width, obj_height, color_palette=[obj_color])
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            # If there's no space, skip this object
            continue

    # Generate the guide object with a unique color
    guide_color = np.random.choice(list(set(Color.NOT_BLACK) - set(np.unique(grid))))
    guide_width, guide_height = np.random.randint(3, 6, size=2)
    guide_sprite = random_sprite(guide_width, guide_height, color_palette=[guide_color])
    try:
        x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, padding=1)
        blit_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, x, y)
    except ValueError:
        pass # If there's no space, the function will retry

    return grid
```

This puzzle challenges students to understand and implement a grid transformation based on detecting a special guide object and using its bounding box to create a new grid. The provided `main` function is deterministic, while the `generate_input` function introduces randomness to create varied puzzles each time it is run.
