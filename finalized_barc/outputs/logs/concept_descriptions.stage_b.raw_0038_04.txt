Sure, let's create a new puzzle based on the description provided:

**Concepts:**
- Object selection
- Connected components
- Filtering

**Description:**
In the input grid, you'll see several connected components (objects) of various sizes and colors. Your task is to extract and filter these objects based on a specific size criterion: only retain objects that have an area greater than a predetermined threshold. The output should be a list of the selected objects, each represented by its bounding box and constituent pixels. Non-selected objects should be excluded from the output.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# object selection, connected components, filtering

# description:
# In the input grid, connected components (objects) of various sizes and colors are placed randomly.
# The task is to filter and retain only those objects that have an area greater than a specified threshold.
# The output should be a list of the selected objects, each represented by its bounding box and constituent pixels.

def main(input_grid):
    # Define the area threshold for filtering
    area_threshold = 5

    # Find all connected components in the input grid
    components = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=4, monochromatic=False)

    # List to store selected objects
    selected_objects = []

    # Filter components based on the area criterion
    for component in components:
        # Calculate the area of the component by counting non-background pixels
        area = np.sum(component != Color.BLACK)
        
        # Retain component if its area is greater than the threshold
        if area > area_threshold:
            # Crop the component to obtain its bounding box
            cropped_component = crop(component, background=Color.BLACK)
            selected_objects.append(cropped_component)

    return selected_objects


def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with random dimensions between 10 and 20
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 21), np.random.randint(10, 21)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Define a number of components to place
    num_components = np.random.randint(3, 7)

    for _ in range(num_components):
        # Generate a random sprite with varied colors and size
        n_sprite, m_sprite = np.random.randint(2, 5), np.random.randint(2, 5)
        color_palette = random.sample(Color.NOT_BLACK, np.random.randint(1, 3))
        sprite = random_sprite(n=n_sprite, m=m_sprite, color_palette=color_palette, connectivity=4)

        # Try to place the sprite in the grid at a random location
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
        except ValueError:
            # If no suitable location is found, continue with the next sprite
            continue

    return grid
```

In this puzzle:
- The `main` function extracts all connected components in the input grid and filters them based on their area.
- Only components with an area greater than a specified threshold are retained and returned.
- The `generate_input` function creates a grid with random components of various sizes and colors, ensuring variability for each puzzle instance.
