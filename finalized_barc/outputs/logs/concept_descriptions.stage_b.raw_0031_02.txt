Certainly! Let's design a puzzle based on identifying objects, moving them, and erasing their original positions.

**Concepts:**
- Object identification
- Translation
- Erasure
- Grid manipulation

**Description:**
Identify a single connected component (object) within the input grid. Determine its bounding box and erase the object by setting its pixels to the background color (0). Translate the object to a specified new position (row, column) by moving its bounding box to the new coordinates. Redraw the object at the new position, preserving its shape and color. The output grid reflects the object moved to the new location with its original position cleared.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# object identification, translation, erasure, grid manipulation

# description:
# Identify a single connected component (object) within the input grid. Determine its bounding box and erase the object by setting its pixels to the background color (0).
# Translate the object to a specified new position (row, column) by moving its bounding box to the new coordinates.
# Redraw the object at the new position, preserving its shape and color.
# The output grid reflects the object moved to the new location with its original position cleared.

def main(input_grid):
    # Copy the input grid to the output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Find the connected components in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=4, monochromatic=False)

    # Assume there's only one object for this puzzle
    assert len(objects) == 1
    obj = objects[0]

    # Determine the bounding box of the object
    x, y, width, height = bounding_box(obj, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Erase the object from its original position
    output_grid[x:x+width, y:y+height] = Color.BLACK

    # Translate the object to a new random position
    new_x, new_y = np.random.randint(0, input_grid.shape[0] - width), np.random.randint(0, input_grid.shape[1] - height)

    # Blit the object at the new position
    blit_sprite(output_grid, crop(obj, background=Color.BLACK), new_x, new_y, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a medium-sized grid
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 15), np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a random object (sprite) with random color
    color_palette = list(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    sprite = random_sprite(np.random.randint(3, 5), np.random.randint(3, 5), color_palette=color_palette, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Find a random free location for the sprite
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, border_size=1, padding=0)

    # Place the sprite on the grid
    blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)

    return grid
```

In this puzzle:

- `main` identifies a single object in the input grid, erases it, and moves it to a new position.
- `generate_input` creates a grid with a single randomly placed object, ensuring it fits within the grid bounds.

This implementation uses functions from `common.py` to handle object detection, translation, and placement, making it suitable for a curious middle-schooler to explore and understand.
