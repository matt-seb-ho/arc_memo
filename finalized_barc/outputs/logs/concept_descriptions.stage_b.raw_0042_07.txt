To create a new puzzle, we will design a system where the transformation involves drawing lines based on a guide object's color. Our transformation will focus on identifying a specific guide object within a grid and using its unique color to draw a line between two specified points or along a specified path. All other non-background cells will remain unchanged.

Here's the implementation of the puzzle with the specified requirements:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *


# concepts:
# guide object, color transfer, line drawing

# description:
# Identify a guide object with a unique color in the grid. Use this color to draw a line between two specified points or along a specified path.
# The line is drawn by overwriting the background cells with the guide object's color. All other non-background cells remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=4, monochromatic=True, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    # We assume there is exactly one object with a unique color that acts as the guide
    guide_object = None
    for obj in objects:
        unique_colors = np.unique(obj[obj != Color.BLACK])
        if len(unique_colors) == 1:
            guide_object = obj
            guide_color = unique_colors[0]
            break

    if guide_object is None:
        raise ValueError("No guide object found")

    # Find the bounding box of the guide object to determine the start and end points for the line
    x, y, w, h = bounding_box(guide_object)
    
    # For simplicity, draw a line from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the bounding box
    start_x, start_y = x, y
    end_x, end_y = x + w - 1, y + h - 1
    
    # Create the output grid by copying the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Draw the line using the guide object's color
    draw_line(output_grid, start_x, start_y, end_x=end_x, end_y=end_y, color=guide_color)
    
    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    grid_size = np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a unique color for the guide object
    guide_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    # Create a guide object with a random shape
    guide_object = random_sprite(n=[2, 3], m=[2, 3], density=0.8, color_palette=[guide_color])

    # Find a random location to place the guide object
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, border_size=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, x, y)
    
    # Optionally, add other random objects with different colors to the grid
    num_other_objects = np.random.randint(1, 3)
    for _ in range(num_other_objects):
        color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK - {guide_color}))
        random_object = random_sprite(n=[2, 3], m=[2, 3], density=0.6, color_palette=[color])
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, random_object, border_size=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, random_object, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            continue
    
    return grid
```

### Explanation:
1. **`main` function**: 
   - It identifies a guide object with a unique color in the input grid.
   - It uses the bounding box of this object to determine a start and end point for drawing a line.
   - It draws a line using the guide object's color from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the bounding box.
   - The line overwrites only the background cells, leaving other non-background cells unchanged.

2. **`generate_input` function**:
   - It creates a grid with a specific size and a unique guide object with a random shape and color.
   - It places this guide object on the grid.
   - It optionally adds other random objects with different colors to add complexity to the grid, ensuring the guide object remains unique in its color.

This setup creates a deterministic transformation based on the description provided, suitable for middle-schoolers to discover the transformation rule.
