Certainly! Let's design a puzzle that involves analyzing a sequence of grids to identify a transformation pattern and predict the next state in the sequence. This puzzle will focus on detecting size changes in objects over time.

### Puzzle Details

**Concepts:**
- Pattern recognition
- Size transformation
- Sequence prediction

**Description:**
The input consists of a sequence of grids representing consecutive time steps with objects, specifically squares, that consistently change in size. The task is to analyze the sequence to detect the size transformation pattern and extrapolate to predict the next grid in the sequence. The output is a single grid that continues the detected pattern logically from the last input grid.

**Example Puzzle Implementation:**

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# pattern recognition, size transformation, sequence prediction

# description:
# The input consists of a sequence of grids where a square changes its size in a consistent manner (either increasing or decreasing).
# The task is to detect the size change pattern and predict the next grid in the sequence by applying the detected size change pattern.

def main(input_grids):
    # The input is a list of grids representing consecutive time steps
    last_grid = input_grids[-1]
    
    # Identify the square object in the last grid
    objects = find_connected_components(last_grid, monochromatic=True, background=Color.BLACK)
    assert len(objects) == 1, "exactly one square expected"
    square = objects[0]

    # Get the bounding box of the square to determine its size
    x, y, w, h = bounding_box(square)
    
    # Calculate the size change pattern from the sequence
    size_changes = []
    for i in range(1, len(input_grids)):
        prev_grid = input_grids[i - 1]
        curr_grid = input_grids[i]
        prev_square = find_connected_components(prev_grid, monochromatic=True, background=Color.BLACK)[0]
        curr_square = find_connected_components(curr_grid, monochromatic=True, background=Color.BLACK)[0]
        
        _, _, prev_w, _ = bounding_box(prev_square)
        _, _, curr_w, _ = bounding_box(curr_square)
        
        size_changes.append(curr_w - prev_w)
    
    # Determine the most consistent size change
    size_change = max(set(size_changes), key=size_changes.count)

    # Predict the size of the square in the next grid
    new_size = max(1, w + size_change)  # Ensure the new size is at least 1

    # Create the next grid
    grid_size = last_grid.shape
    next_grid = np.full(grid_size, Color.BLACK)

    # Draw the new square in the center of the grid
    start_x = (grid_size[0] - new_size) // 2
    start_y = (grid_size[1] - new_size) // 2
    for i in range(new_size):
        for j in range(new_size):
            next_grid[start_x + i, start_y + j] = Color.TEAL  # Assume the square is teal

    return next_grid

def generate_input():
    # Randomly choose the size of the grid
    grid_size = np.random.randint(10, 15)
    
    # Randomly choose the initial size of the square
    initial_size = np.random.randint(2, 5)
    
    # Randomly choose the size change (positive for growing, negative for shrinking)
    size_change = np.random.choice([-1, 1])
    
    # Determine the number of steps in the sequence
    num_steps = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    
    # Generate a sequence of grids
    grids = []
    current_size = initial_size
    for _ in range(num_steps):
        grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), Color.BLACK)
        
        # Calculate the position to center the square
        start_x = (grid_size - current_size) // 2
        start_y = (grid_size - current_size) // 2
        
        # Draw the square
        for i in range(current_size):
            for j in range(current_size):
                grid[start_x + i, start_y + j] = Color.TEAL  # Assume the square is teal

        grids.append(grid)
        
        # Update the size for the next step
        current_size = max(1, current_size + size_change)  # Ensure size is at least 1
    
    return grids
```

In this puzzle, we assume a single square object that changes size consistently over time. The solution involves analyzing the size change pattern and predicting the next step. The `generate_input` function creates random sequences of such transformations.
