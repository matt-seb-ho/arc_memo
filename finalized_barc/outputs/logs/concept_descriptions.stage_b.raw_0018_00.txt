Here's a potential implementation of the puzzle based on the given description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# recolor, guide object, connected components

# description:
# The input consists of a grid with at least two distinct objects: a target object and a guide object.
# Identify the target object and change its color to match the color of the guide object. 
# The guide object is distinct and serves as the reference for the new color.
# All other grid elements remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Detect all objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(grid=input_grid, connectivity=4)

    # Assume the largest object is the target and the smallest is the guide
    target_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))
    guide_object = min(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))

    # Find the color of the guide object
    guide_color = guide_object[guide_object != Color.BLACK][0]

    # Change the color of the target object to match the guide object
    target_object[target_object != Color.BLACK] = guide_color

    # Place all objects back into the output grid
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    for obj in objects:
        output_grid = blit_object(output_grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid

def generate_input() -> np.ndarray:
    # Define grid size
    grid_size = 10

    # Create an empty grid
    grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a target object with a random color
    target_color = random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    target_object = random_sprite(n=[3, 4, 5], m=[3, 4, 5], color_palette=[target_color])
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, target_object, padding=1)
    grid = blit_sprite(grid, target_object, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a guide object with a different random color
    guide_color = random.choice([c for c in Color.NOT_BLACK if c != target_color])
    guide_object = random_sprite(n=[1, 2], m=[1, 2], color_palette=[guide_color])
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, padding=1)
    grid = blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Optionally, add more random objects to fill the grid
    while True:
        random_color = random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)
        random_object = random_sprite(n=[1, 2, 3], m=[1, 2, 3], color_palette=[random_color])
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, random_object, padding=1)
            grid = blit_sprite(grid, random_object, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
        except ValueError:
            break

    return grid
```

### Explanation

- **Concepts**: The puzzle involves identifying connected components, recoloring one of them based on another, which serves as a guide.
- **Description**: The function `main` takes an input grid containing multiple objects and identifies a target and a guide object. The target object's color is changed to match the guide. The function `generate_input` creates random grids with at least two distinct objects, ensuring variability and replayability.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - `find_connected_components` is used to identify distinct objects in the grid.
  - The guide and target objects are determined based on their sizes (smallest and largest).
  - `blit_object` is used to place the transformed objects back onto the grid.
- **Randomness**: The `generate_input` function ensures that each generated grid is different, providing a stochastic input setup for the puzzle.
