Below is the implementation of the puzzle described. The puzzle involves window processing, predicate check, conditional fill, and grid manipulation. The `generate_input` function stochastically creates input grids, and the `main` function applies the deterministic transformation based on the given description.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# window processing, predicate check, conditional fill, grid manipulation

# description:
# Input is a grid with specific 3x3 window coordinates and a predicate function.
# For each cell within the specified 3x3 window, check if it satisfies the predicate.
# If a cell does not satisfy the predicate, replace its value with a specified fill_value.
# Cells that satisfy the predicate remain unchanged.
# This operation completes the pattern within the window by filling only the non-matching cells.

def main(input_data: Tuple[np.ndarray, Tuple[int, int], Callable[[int], bool], int]) -> np.ndarray:
    input_grid, window_coords, predicate, fill_value = input_data

    # Extract the 3x3 window coordinates
    x_start, y_start = window_coords
    x_end, y_end = x_start + 3, y_start + 3

    # Make a copy of the input grid to avoid modifying the original
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Process each cell within the 3x3 window
    for x in range(x_start, x_end):
        for y in range(y_start, y_end):
            if not predicate(input_grid[x, y]):
                # Replace the cell value with the fill_value if predicate is not satisfied
                output_grid[x, y] = fill_value

    return output_grid

def generate_input() -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Tuple[int, int], Callable[[int], bool], int]:
    # Create a random grid of size 10x10 with colors from 0 to 9 (non-black)
    grid_size = 10
    grid = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK, size=(grid_size, grid_size))

    # Randomly choose a top-left corner for the 3x3 window within the grid
    x_start = np.random.randint(0, grid_size - 3)
    y_start = np.random.randint(0, grid_size - 3)

    # Define a random predicate function (e.g., check if color is even)
    predicate = lambda color: color % 2 == 0

    # Choose a random fill value from the color palette
    fill_value = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)

    return grid, (x_start, y_start), predicate, fill_value
```

### Explanation:

- **Grid Generation (`generate_input`)**: 
  - The `generate_input` function creates a 10x10 grid filled with random colors from the `Color.NOT_BLACK` palette.
  - It randomly selects a starting position for a 3x3 window.
  - It defines a predicate function that checks if a color is even.
  - It selects a random fill color to replace non-matching cells.

- **Transformation (`main`)**:
  - The `main` function processes the grid according to the specified 3x3 window and predicate.
  - It iterates over each cell in the window. If a cell does not satisfy the predicate, its value is replaced with the `fill_value`.
  - This transformation ensures the pattern within the window is completed by filling the non-matching cells.

This puzzle encourages students to think about window processing, conditional checks, and grid manipulation, providing a fun and educational challenge.
