Here's the implementation of the puzzle that involves using Bresenham's line algorithm to connect two distinct pixels with a specified line color. We'll use the `draw_line` function to achieve this.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# line drawing, pixel connectivity, grid update

# description:
# In the input, you will see a grid with two distinct pixels marked as start and end with specific colors.
# To make the output, draw a straight line connecting these two pixels using Bresenham's line algorithm.
# Update the grid by coloring each pixel along the path with a specified line color. All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Copy the input grid to the output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Identify the start and end points by their unique colors
    start_color = Color.RED
    end_color = Color.BLUE
    line_color = Color.GREEN  # The color of the line to be drawn

    # Find the position of the start and end pixels
    start_pos = np.argwhere(input_grid == start_color)[0]
    end_pos = np.argwhere(input_grid == end_color)[0]

    # Extract the coordinates
    x_start, y_start = start_pos
    x_end, y_end = end_pos

    # Draw the line using Bresenham's line algorithm
    draw_line(output_grid, x_start, y_start, end_x=x_end, end_y=y_end, color=line_color)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of random size between 10x10 and 20x20
    n = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    m = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    grid = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)

    # Choose two distinct random colors for start and end
    start_color = Color.RED
    end_color = Color.BLUE

    # Randomly select two distinct positions on the grid for start and end
    x_start, y_start = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    x_end, y_end = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)

    # Ensure the start and end points are distinct
    while (x_start == x_end and y_start == y_end):
        x_end, y_end = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)

    # Set the start and end colors on the grid
    grid[x_start, y_start] = start_color
    grid[x_end, y_end] = end_color

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
- **Concepts:** The puzzle involves line drawing and grid manipulation using Bresenham's line algorithm.
- **Description:** The input grid has two distinct colored pixels representing the start and end points. The task is to draw a line connecting these points using Bresenham's line algorithm and color the path with a specified line color, leaving other pixels unchanged.
- **Implementation:**
  - The `main` function identifies the start and end positions using their colors and draws a line between them.
  - The `generate_input` function creates a grid with random dimensions and places two distinct colored pixels at random positions to serve as the start and end points.
