Let's create a puzzle where we need to draw a line between two points. The path can be obstructed by obstacles, and the goal is to find a route that navigates around these obstacles.

# Concepts:
- Obstacles
- Path blocking
- Line finding
- Detours

# Description:
- In the input, you will see a grid with a start point marked in green, an endpoint marked in red, and several obstacles marked in blue.
- The task is to connect the start point to the endpoint with a continuous line that avoids the obstacles.
- The line should be drawn in yellow.
- If an obstacle is encountered, the path should take a detour around it.

Here is the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# obstacles, path blocking, line finding, detours

# description:
# In the input, you will see a grid with a start point marked in green, an endpoint marked in red, and several obstacles marked in blue.
# The task is to connect the start point to the endpoint with a continuous line that avoids the obstacles.
# The line should be drawn in yellow. If an obstacle is encountered, the path should take a detour around it.

def main(input_grid):
    # Plan:
    # 1. Parse the input to find the start point, endpoint, and obstacles
    # 2. Use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to navigate from start to end, avoiding obstacles
    # 3. Draw the path on the grid using yellow color

    # 1. Parse the input
    background = Color.BLACK
    start_position = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.GREEN)[0]
    end_position = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.RED)[0]
    obstacles = (input_grid == Color.BLUE)

    # 2. Implement A* pathfinding algorithm
    def heuristic(a, b):
        return abs(a[0] - b[0]) + abs(a[1] - b[1])

    def astar(start, goal, obstacles):
        from heapq import heappop, heappush
        open_set = []
        heappush(open_set, (0, start))
        came_from = {}
        g_score = {start: 0}
        f_score = {start: heuristic(start, goal)}

        while open_set:
            _, current = heappop(open_set)

            if current == goal:
                path = []
                while current in came_from:
                    path.append(current)
                    current = came_from[current]
                path.append(start)
                path.reverse()
                return path

            for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:  # 4 directions
                neighbor = (current[0] + dx, current[1] + dy)
                if 0 <= neighbor[0] < input_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= neighbor[1] < input_grid.shape[1]:
                    if obstacles[neighbor]:
                        continue
                    tentative_g_score = g_score[current] + 1
                    if neighbor not in g_score or tentative_g_score < g_score[neighbor]:
                        came_from[neighbor] = current
                        g_score[neighbor] = tentative_g_score
                        f_score[neighbor] = tentative_g_score + heuristic(neighbor, goal)
                        heappush(open_set, (f_score[neighbor], neighbor))
        return []

    # 3. Draw the path
    path = astar(tuple(start_position), tuple(end_position), obstacles)
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    for x, y in path:
        if output_grid[x, y] not in [Color.GREEN, Color.RED]:
            output_grid[x, y] = Color.YELLOW

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid with a start point, endpoint, and several obstacles
    n = np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((n, n), Color.BLACK)

    # Place start point
    start_x, start_y = np.random.randint(0, n, size=2)
    grid[start_x, start_y] = Color.GREEN

    # Place endpoint at a different location
    end_x, end_y = start_x, start_y
    while end_x == start_x and end_y == start_y:
        end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n, size=2)
    grid[end_x, end_y] = Color.RED

    # Place obstacles
    num_obstacles = np.random.randint(n // 2, n)
    for _ in range(num_obstacles):
        obs_x, obs_y = np.random.randint(0, n, size=2)
        if grid[obs_x, obs_y] == Color.BLACK:
            grid[obs_x, obs_y] = Color.BLUE

    return grid
```

This code block implements the puzzle described. The input is generated with random placements of start, end, and obstacles, while the main function uses the A* algorithm to find a path that avoids obstacles and connects the start and end points with a yellow line.
