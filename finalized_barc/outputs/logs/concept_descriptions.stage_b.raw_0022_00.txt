Sure! Let's create a new puzzle based on the description provided. This puzzle will involve detecting objects in a sequence of grids and extrapolating their movements over time.

## Puzzle Description:
- **Concepts**: Object tracking, linear movement, pattern extrapolation
- **Description**: 
  - The input consists of a sequence of grids representing consecutive time steps. Each grid contains one or more colored objects that consistently move in a straight line. 
  - The task is to analyze the sequence to identify the movement pattern of each object. 
  - The output is a grid that predicts the next position of each object based on its detected linear movement.

Here is the implementation of the `main` and `generate_input` functions for this puzzle:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# object tracking, linear movement, pattern extrapolation

# description:
# The input consists of a sequence of grids representing consecutive time steps. Each grid contains one or more colored objects moving linearly.
# The task is to analyze the sequence to identify the movement pattern of each object and predict the next position of each object.

def main(input_grids):
    # We assume input_grids is a list of 2D numpy arrays representing the grids at each time step

    # Extract the number of time steps and the grid dimensions
    num_steps = len(input_grids)
    grid_height, grid_width = input_grids[0].shape

    # Create an output grid for the next time step prediction
    output_grid = np.zeros((grid_height, grid_width), dtype=int)

    # Track each object's movement across the time steps
    objects_trajectory = {}

    for t, grid in enumerate(input_grids):
        objects = find_connected_components(grid, monochromatic=True, background=Color.BLACK)

        for obj in objects:
            color = object_colors(obj)[0]
            x, y = object_position(obj, background=Color.BLACK)

            if color not in objects_trajectory:
                objects_trajectory[color] = []
            
            objects_trajectory[color].append((x, y))

    # Extrapolate each object's movement to predict the next position
    for color, trajectory in objects_trajectory.items():
        if len(trajectory) >= 2:
            # Calculate movement vector based on last two positions
            (x1, y1), (x2, y2) = trajectory[-2], trajectory[-1]
            dx, dy = x2 - x1, y2 - y1

            # Predict the next position
            next_x, next_y = x2 + dx, y2 + dy

            # Place the object in the predicted position if within grid bounds
            if 0 <= next_x < grid_width and 0 <= next_y < grid_height:
                output_grid[next_x, next_y] = color

    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Generate a sequence of grids with moving objects

    # Random grid size
    grid_height, grid_width = np.random.randint(5, 10, size=2)

    # Number of time steps in the sequence
    num_steps = np.random.randint(3, 5)

    # Create a list to store the sequence of grids
    input_grids = []

    # Number of objects
    num_objects = np.random.randint(1, 4)

    # Initialize positions and velocities for each object
    positions = [np.array([np.random.randint(0, grid_height), np.random.randint(0, grid_width)]) for _ in range(num_objects)]
    velocities = [np.array([np.random.choice([-1, 0, 1]), np.random.choice([-1, 0, 1])]) for _ in range(num_objects)]
    colors = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), size=num_objects, replace=False)

    for _ in range(num_steps):
        # Create a new grid for this time step
        grid = np.zeros((grid_height, grid_width), dtype=int)

        # Update positions and draw objects
        for i in range(num_objects):
            x, y = positions[i]
            color = colors[i]

            # Place the object
            grid[x, y] = color

            # Update position for next time step
            next_x, next_y = positions[i] + velocities[i]

            # Ensure the object stays within bounds, bounce if necessary
            if not (0 <= next_x < grid_height):
                velocities[i][0] *= -1
            if not (0 <= next_y < grid_width):
                velocities[i][1] *= -1
            positions[i] = positions[i] + velocities[i]

        input_grids.append(grid)

    return input_grids
```

### Explanation:
- **`main` Function**: 
  - It takes a list of grids as input, each representing a time step.
  - It tracks the movement of each colored object, calculates their movement vectors based on their last two positions, and extrapolates the next position.
  - It outputs a grid with the predicted new positions of the objects.

- **`generate_input` Function**: 
  - It creates a sequence of grids with randomly placed moving objects.
  - Each object is assigned a random initial position and velocity.
  - The grids are populated in sequence, with each object's position updated according to its velocity, and objects are made to bounce off the grid edges.
