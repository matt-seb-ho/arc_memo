To create the puzzle based on the given description, we will implement a Python code block using the provided `common.py` library for handling 2D grids and colors. This puzzle will involve identifying the orientation of a single connected object on a grid by detecting which corner in its bounding box is missing, then recoloring the object based on its orientation. Let's implement the functions `generate_input` and `main` accordingly:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# orientation detection, recolor, connected components, bounding box

# description:
# The input grid contains a single connected object. The task is to determine the object's orientation by identifying the missing corner in its bounding box:
# top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right. Recolor the entire object uniformly based on this orientation using a fixed color map:
# - top-left to red (3)
# - top-right to yellow (4)
# - bottom-left to green (2)
# - bottom-right to blue (1)
# The background and any other grid content remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Extract the single connected object from the input grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, monochromatic=True, connectivity=8)
    
    # There should be exactly one object
    assert len(objects) == 1, "The input should contain exactly one connected object"
    obj = objects[0]
    
    # Determine the bounding box of the object
    x, y, width, height = bounding_box(obj)
    
    # Identify the missing corner
    missing_corners = [(x, y), (x, y + height - 1), (x + width - 1, y), (x + width - 1, y + height - 1)]
    present_corners = set(np.argwhere(obj != Color.BLACK).tolist())
    missing_corner = next(corner for corner in missing_corners if corner not in present_corners)
    
    # Map the missing corner to the appropriate color
    orientation_to_color = {
        (x, y): Color.RED,         # top-left
        (x, y + height - 1): Color.YELLOW,  # top-right
        (x + width - 1, y): Color.GREEN,   # bottom-left
        (x + width - 1, y + height - 1): Color.BLUE    # bottom-right
    }
    
    # Get the new color for the object based on its missing corner
    new_color = orientation_to_color[missing_corner]
    
    # Recolor the object uniformly
    obj[obj != Color.BLACK] = new_color
    
    # Create the output grid and place the recolored object
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    blit_object(output_grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Define grid dimensions
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 20), np.random.randint(10, 20)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Generate a random connected object with a missing corner
    object_size = np.random.randint(3, min(n, m) // 2)
    obj = random_sprite(object_size, object_size, density=0.7, color_palette=[Color.GREY], connectivity=8)
    
    # Manually remove one corner to create a missing corner effect
    x, y, width, height = bounding_box(obj, background=Color.BLACK)
    missing_corners = [(x, y), (x, y + height - 1), (x + width - 1, y), (x + width - 1, y + height - 1)]
    missing_corner = np.random.choice(len(missing_corners))
    obj[missing_corners[missing_corner]] = Color.BLACK
    
    # Place the object randomly in the grid
    try:
        x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, obj, padding=1, padding_connectivity=8)
        blit_sprite(grid, obj, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
    except ValueError:
        pass  # In rare cases, there might not be enough space; retrying the generation is recommended
    
    return grid
```

In this implementation:
- `generate_input` creates a single connected object with a missing corner and places it on a grid.
- `main` identifies the object's orientation by detecting the missing corner of its bounding box and recolors the object accordingly using a predefined color map. The output grid retains the original background and other grid content unchanged.
