# concepts:
# object movement, grid update, erase and redraw

# description:
# In the input, you will see a grid with several objects of different colors against a black background. One of the objects is marked with a unique color (e.g., BLUE).
# To make the output, identify the object with the unique color, erase it from its original position, and move it to a target position on the grid.
# The target position is marked by a distinct color (e.g., MAROON) and does not overlap with any other objects.
# The output grid will have the object at its new position with all other elements unchanged.

    # 1. Identify the object to move using the unique color.

    # 4. Erase the object from its original position and redraw it at the target position.
