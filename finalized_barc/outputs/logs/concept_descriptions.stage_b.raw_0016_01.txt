Here is my implementation of the puzzle based on your description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# holes, guide object, filling, connected components, interior regions

# description:
# The input consists of a guide object and a target object on a grid. Identify all interior holes within the guide object that are not connected to the border (using 4-connectivity).
# For each hole, determine if the target object can be fully or partially filled into these holes, akin to a Tetris-style filling.
# The output is a list of hole objects, each represented by its pixel coordinates, where the target object can be placed. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find connected components in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=4, monochromatic=False)

    # Separate guide and target objects
    guide_object = [obj for obj in objects if np.any(obj == Color.RED)][0]
    target_object = [obj for obj in objects if np.any(obj == Color.BLUE)][0]

    # Create an output grid to store the result
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # Find the interior holes of the guide object
    interior_mask = object_interior(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)
    hole_mask = interior_mask & (guide_object == Color.BLACK)

    # Find the connected components of the holes
    holes = find_connected_components(hole_mask, background=False, connectivity=4, monochromatic=True)

    # Check if the target object can fit into each hole
    for hole in holes:
        hole_sprite = crop(hole, background=False)
        target_sprite = crop(target_object, background=Color.BLACK)

        # Check if target can be fully or partially filled into the hole
        if target_sprite.shape[0] <= hole_sprite.shape[0] and target_sprite.shape[1] <= hole_sprite.shape[1]:
            # Determine placement position
            hole_x, hole_y = object_position(hole, background=False)
            # Blit the target object into the hole
            blit_sprite(output_grid, target_sprite, hole_x, hole_y, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Create a grid
    grid_size = np.random.randint(12, 20)
    grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), Color.BLACK)

    # Add a guide object (red border)
    guide_size = np.random.randint(5, grid_size - 2)
    guide_object = np.full((guide_size, guide_size), Color.RED)
    guide_object[1:-1, 1:-1] = Color.BLACK

    # Position guide object on the grid
    guide_x, guide_y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, background=Color.BLACK, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, guide_x, guide_y, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Add a target object (blue)
    target_size = np.random.randint(2, guide_size - 1)
    target_object = random_sprite(target_size, target_size, color_palette=[Color.BLUE], background=Color.BLACK)
    
    # Position target object on the grid
    target_x, target_y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, target_object, background=Color.BLACK, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, target_object, target_x, target_y, background=Color.BLACK)

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **`main` Function**: 
   - This function first identifies the connected components in the grid.
   - It separates the guide object and the target object based on their colors (red for the guide object and blue for the target object).
   - It then finds the interior holes of the guide object that are not connected to the border.
   - For each hole, it checks if the target object can fit into it, and if so, blits the target object into the hole.

2. **`generate_input` Function**: 
   - This function generates a random grid with a guide object (red border) and a target object (blue).
   - The guide object is a red square with a hollow black interior placed randomly on the grid.
   - The target object is a blue sprite, also placed randomly on the grid.
