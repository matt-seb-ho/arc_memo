Sure! Let's implement the puzzle that involves drawing a line between two marked points on a grid using Bresenham's line algorithm. The puzzle requires designing a deterministic function `main` and a stochastic input generator `generate_input`. Below is the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# line drawing, pixel connectivity, grid update

# description:
# Given a grid with two distinct pixels marked as start and end, draw a straight line connecting these two pixels. Use Bresenham's line algorithm to determine the path of the line. Update the grid by coloring each pixel along the path with a specified line color. All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Plan:
    # 1. Extract the positions of the start and end points from the input grid
    # 2. Use Bresenham's line algorithm to find the path between these two points
    # 3. Color each pixel along the path with the line color

    # 1. Extract the start and end points
    start_point = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.BLUE)[0]
    end_point = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.RED)[0]

    # 2. Bresenham's line algorithm
    def bresenham_line(x0, y0, x1, y1):
        points = []
        dx = abs(x1 - x0)
        dy = abs(y1 - y0)
        sx = 1 if x0 < x1 else -1
        sy = 1 if y0 < y1 else -1
        err = dx - dy

        while True:
            points.append((x0, y0))
            if x0 == x1 and y0 == y1:
                break
            e2 = 2 * err
            if e2 > -dy:
                err -= dy
                x0 += sx
            if e2 < dx:
                err += dx
                y0 += sy
        return points

    # 3. Draw the line on the grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    line_color = Color.GREEN
    path_points = bresenham_line(start_point[0], start_point[1], end_point[0], end_point[1])
    for x, y in path_points:
        output_grid[x, y] = line_color

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a random grid with a start and end point
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 15, size=2)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Randomly place the start and end points
    start_x, start_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    
    # Ensure start and end points are not the same
    while start_x == end_x and start_y == end_y:
        end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)

    grid[start_x, start_y] = Color.BLUE
    grid[end_x, end_y] = Color.RED

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
1. **Concepts**: This puzzle involves line drawing using Bresenham's algorithm, pixel connectivity, and updating a grid.
2. **Description**: The task is to draw a straight line between two marked points on a grid. The start point is marked with blue, and the end point is marked with red. The line drawn between them will be green. The implementation uses Bresenham's line algorithm to calculate the path of the line.
3. **`main` Function**: Finds the start and end points, computes the line path using Bresenham's algorithm, and updates the grid by coloring the path pixels.
4. **`generate_input` Function**: Creates a grid of random size, places start and end points randomly, and ensures they are not the same location.
