To design the puzzle based on the description provided, we will create a puzzle where the player must identify a guide object with a unique color and use this color to draw a line between two specified points on the grid. Here's how we can implement this:

1. The `generate_input` function will create a grid with a guide object (a distinct color), two specified points (start and end), and a background.
2. The `main` function will take the input grid, identify the guide object, and draw a line between the start and end points using the guide object's color. The line will overwrite the background but leave any non-background cells unchanged.

Let's implement this puzzle:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, color transfer, line drawing

# description:
# In the input grid, there is a guide object of a unique color and two specific points marked in red and blue respectively.
# The task is to draw a line from the red point to the blue point using the color of the guide object. 
# The line should overwrite any background cells but not affect other colored cells.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)
    
    # Identify the guide object by finding the unique color that isn't background, red, or blue
    guide_color = None
    for obj in objects:
        unique_colors = set(np.unique(obj))
        unique_colors -= {Color.BLACK, Color.RED, Color.BLUE}
        if unique_colors:
            guide_color = unique_colors.pop()
            break
    
    assert guide_color is not None, "Guide object not found"

    # Find the positions of the red and blue points
    red_position = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.RED)[0]
    blue_position = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.BLUE)[0]

    # Copy the input grid to output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Draw the line using the guide color
    draw_line(output_grid, red_position[0], red_position[1], end_x=blue_position[0], end_y=blue_position[1], color=guide_color, stop_at_color=[Color.RED, Color.BLUE])

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with a random size between 10x10 and 20x20
    n = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    grid = np.full((n, n), Color.BLACK, dtype=int)
    
    # Generate a random guide object
    guide_sprite = random_sprite(np.random.randint(2, 5), np.random.randint(2, 5), color_palette=[np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK - {Color.RED, Color.BLUE}))])
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, border_size=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, x, y)

    # Mark two points with red and blue
    red_x, red_y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, np.ones((1, 1)), padding=1, border_size=1)
    grid[red_x, red_y] = Color.RED
    
    blue_x, blue_y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, np.ones((1, 1)), padding=1, border_size=1)
    grid[blue_x, blue_y] = Color.BLUE
    
    return grid
```

In this puzzle implementation:
- The `generate_input` function creates a grid with a guide object, and two points marked in red and blue.
- The `main` function identifies the guide color and draws a line between the red and blue points using the guide color. The line is drawn over the background but leaves other colored areas unchanged. This implementation will provide middle schoolers a fun challenge in identifying the guide object and using its color to connect points on the grid!
