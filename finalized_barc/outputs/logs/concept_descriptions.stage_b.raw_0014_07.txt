Here's the implementation for the puzzle described, where the goal is to identify all connected components in a grid, determine their colors, and select the object whose color is unique among all objects. The output highlights or isolates the guide object based on its unique color, while all other objects remain unchanged.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# unique color selection, connected components, object identification, guide object

# description:
# In the input grid, identify all connected components and determine their colors. Select the object whose color is unique (not shared by any other object) as the guide object.
# The output is the grid with the guide object highlighted or isolated based on its unique color, while all other objects remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all the connected components in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=4, monochromatic=True)
    
    # Count the occurrence of each color
    color_count = {}
    for obj in objects:
        # Get the color of the object (all pixels in the object will have the same color)
        obj_color = np.unique(obj[obj != Color.BLACK])[0]
        if obj_color in color_count:
            color_count[obj_color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[obj_color] = 1
    
    # Find the color that is unique
    unique_color = None
    for color, count in color_count.items():
        if count == 1:
            unique_color = color
            break
    
    # Create the output grid
    output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, Color.BLACK)

    # Highlight or isolate the guide object with the unique color
    for obj in objects:
        obj_color = np.unique(obj[obj != Color.BLACK])[0]
        if obj_color == unique_color:
            blit_object(output_grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a random grid with multiple objects of different colors
    grid_size = np.random.randint(10, 15)
    input_grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Select a random number of objects to generate
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    
    # Choose colors for the objects
    available_colors = list(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    np.random.shuffle(available_colors)
    
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        # Create a random sprite with a chosen color
        color = available_colors.pop()
        sprite_size = np.random.randint(2, 4)
        sprite = random_sprite(n=sprite_size, m=sprite_size, color_palette=[color], density=0.5)
        
        # Place the sprite in a random location on the grid
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(input_grid, sprite, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(input_grid, sprite, x=x, y=y)
        except ValueError:
            # If no space is left, break early
            break
    
    return input_grid
```

### Explanation:

- **`main` function**: The function processes the input grid to identify connected components and their colors. It then finds the unique color that appears only once among the components. The guide object is then isolated based on this unique color, and the output grid highlights or isolates this guide object.

- **`generate_input` function**: Generates an input grid with randomly placed colored objects. It ensures that at least one object has a unique color by using a shuffled list of colors, which guarantees uniqueness in at least one object.

This implementation uses the provided `common.py` functions to achieve the desired transformation and random input generation.
