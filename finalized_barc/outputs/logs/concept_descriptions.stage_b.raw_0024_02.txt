Let's design a new puzzle with the following specifications:

**Concepts:**
connected components, recoloring, gradient color scheme

**Description:**
Identify a single connected object in the input grid. Recolor the object using a gradient color scheme starting from the top-left corner of its bounding box, fading towards the bottom-right. The gradient should transition from one color to another, e.g., from blue to green. The rest of the grid should remain unchanged.

Here is the implemented puzzle in Python:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# connected components, recoloring, gradient color scheme

# description:
# Identify a single connected object in the input grid. Recolor the object using a gradient color scheme starting from the top-left corner of its bounding box, fading towards the bottom-right. The gradient should transition from one color to another, e.g., from blue to green. The rest of the grid should remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all connected components in the input grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=8)

    # Select the largest object to apply the gradient recolor
    selected_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))
    
    # Get the bounding box coordinates of the selected object
    x, y, width, height = bounding_box(selected_object)
    
    # Create a gradient color map from blue to green
    gradient_colors = [Color.BLUE, Color.GREEN]
    gradient = np.linspace(0, 1, max(width, height))
    
    # Create a copy of the input grid for transformation
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # Apply the gradient color transformation
    for i in range(width):
        for j in range(height):
            if selected_object[i + x, j + y] != Color.BLACK:
                blend_ratio = (i + j) / (width + height - 2)
                color_index = int(blend_ratio * (len(gradient_colors) - 1))
                output_grid[i + x, j + y] = gradient_colors[color_index]
    
    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid with random size and a single connected object
    n = np.random.randint(10, 15)
    input_grid = np.full((n, n), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Generate a random sprite with a random color
    sprite_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    sprite = random_sprite(n//2, n//2, color_palette=[sprite_color], connectivity=8)
    
    # Place the sprite in the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(input_grid, sprite, border_size=1)
    blit_sprite(input_grid, sprite, x, y)
    
    return input_grid
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Main Function**: 
  - We first find all connected components in the input grid and select the largest object. This ensures that we're working with a single, significant object.
  - We calculate the bounding box of this object and create a gradient color map from blue to green.
  - Using the bounding box dimensions, we apply a gradient transformation to the object within its region on the grid. The gradient is applied diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right of the object's bounding box.

- **Generate Input Function**: 
  - The grid size is randomly chosen between 10 and 15 to ensure variability.
  - A single connected object is generated with a random color from the available palette (excluding black) and placed onto the grid.
  - The sprite is positioned ensuring it is fully within the bounds of the grid and not overlapping any borders.

This setup ensures that each time the puzzle is generated, it presents a new instance of the input while maintaining the same transformation logic.
