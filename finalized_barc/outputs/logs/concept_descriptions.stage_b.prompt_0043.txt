You are a puzzle maker designing geometric, physical, and topological puzzles for curious middle-schoolers.

Each puzzle consists of uncovering a deterministic rule, pattern, procedure, algorithm, or transformation law that maps inputs to outputs.
Both the inputs and outputs are 2D grids of colored pixels. There are 10 colors, but the order of the colors is never relevant to the puzzle.

The middle schoolers are trying to discover this deterministic transformation, which can be implemented as a Python function called `main`.
Designing a puzzle involves also creating example inputs, which can be implemented as a Python function called `generate_input`. Unlike `main`, the `generate_input` function should be stochastic, so that every time you run it, you get another good example of what the transformation can be applied to.

Here is a overview of the puzzle you are designing:

Concepts: 
boolean mask, predicate evaluation, pattern recognition, template creation

Description: 
Input is a grid region (block) and a predicate function. Evaluate the predicate at each cell in the block to produce a boolean mask, where each mask cell is True if the predicate is satisfied at that location, otherwise False. This mask serves as a reusable template for identifying the pattern in other grid regions.

Please implement the puzzle by writing code containing the `generate_input` and `main` functions. Use the following standard library (`common.py`):

```python
def draw_line(grid, x, y, end_x=None, end_y=None, length=None, direction=None, color=None, stop_at_color=[]):
    """
    Draws a line starting at (x, y) extending to (end_x, end_y) or of the specified length in the specified direction
    Direction should be a vector with elements -1, 0, or 1.
    If length is None, then the line will continue until it hits the edge of the grid.

    stop_at_color: optional list of colors that the line should stop at. If the line hits a pixel of one of these colors, it will stop.

    Returns the endpoint of the line.

    Example:
    # blue diagonal line from (0, 0) to (2, 2)
    stop_x, stop_y = draw_line(grid, 0, 0, length=3, color=blue, direction=(1, 1))
    draw_line(grid, 0, 0, end_x=2, end_y=2, color=blue)
    assert (stop_x, stop_y) == (2, 2)
    """

def find_connected_components(grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=4, monochromatic=True):
    """
    Find the connected components in the grid. Returns a list of connected components, where each connected component is a numpy array.

    connectivity: 4 or 8, for 4-way or 8-way connectivity.
    monochromatic: if True, each connected component is assumed to have only one color. If False, each connected component can include multiple colors.
    """

def randomly_scatter_points(grid, color, density=0.5, background=Color.BLACK):
    """
    Randomly scatter points of the specified color in the grid with specified density.

    Example usage:

Your task is to implement the puzzle, following these steps:

1. Inspect the example puzzle implementations, making note of the functions used and the physical/geometric/topological/logical details
2. Inspect the new puzzle's description
3. Brainstorm a possible implementation for the new puzzle
4. Generate a code block formatted like the earlier examples with a comment starting `# concepts:` listing the concepts and `# description:` describing the inputs and transformation from the given description.

Be sure to make the transformation `main` deterministic. Follow the description closely.
