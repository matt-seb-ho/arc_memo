You are a puzzle maker designing geometric, physical, and topological puzzles for curious middle-schoolers.

Each puzzle consists of uncovering a deterministic rule, pattern, procedure, algorithm, or transformation law that maps inputs to outputs.
Both the inputs and outputs are 2D grids of colored pixels. There are 10 colors, but the order of the colors is never relevant to the puzzle.

The middle schoolers are trying to discover this deterministic transformation, which can be implemented as a Python function called `main`.
Designing a puzzle involves also creating example inputs, which can be implemented as a Python function called `generate_input`. Unlike `main`, the `generate_input` function should be stochastic, so that every time you run it, you get another good example of what the transformation can be applied to.

Here is a overview of the puzzle you are designing:

Concepts: 
unique color selection, connected components, guide object identification

Description: 
Extract all connected components from the grid. Identify the guide object as the one whose color is unique among all components. The guide object is the only one with a color that no other object shares. All other objects are ignored in the output.

Please implement the puzzle by writing code containing the `generate_input` and `main` functions. Use the following standard library (`common.py`):

```python
def find_connected_components(grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=4, monochromatic=True):
    """
    Find the connected components in the grid. Returns a list of connected components, where each connected component is a numpy array.

    connectivity: 4 or 8, for 4-way or 8-way connectivity.
    monochromatic: if True, each connected component is assumed to have only one color. If False, each connected component can include multiple colors.
    """

def blit_object(grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK):
    """
    Draws an object onto the grid using its current location.

    Example usage:
    blit_object(output_grid, an_object, background=background_color)
    """

def blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y, background=Color.BLACK):
    """
    Draws a sprite onto the grid at the specified location.

    Example usage:
    blit_sprite(output_grid, the_sprite, x=x, y=y, background=background_color)
    """

def bounding_box(grid, background=Color.BLACK):
    """
    Find the bounding box of the non-background pixels in the grid.
    Returns a tuple (x, y, width, height) of the bounding box.

    Example usage:
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, monochromatic=True, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8)
    teal_object = [ obj for obj in objects if np.any(obj == Color.TEAL) ][0]
    teal_x, teal_y, teal_w, teal_h = bounding_box(teal_object)
    """

def crop(grid, background=Color.BLACK):
    """
    Crop the grid to the smallest bounding box that contains all non-background pixels.

    Example usage:
    # Extract a sprite from an object
    sprite = crop(an_object, background=background_color)
    """

def contact(_=None, object1=None, object2=None, x1=0, y1=0, x2=0, y2=0, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=4):
    """
    Check if object1 and object2 touch each other (have contact) when object1 is at (x1, y1) and object2 is at (x2, y2).
    They are touching each other if they share a border, or if they overlap. Collision implies contact, but contact does not imply collision.

    connectivity: 4 or 8, for 4-way or 8-way connectivity. (8-way counts diagonals as touching, 4-way only counts cardinal directions as touching)

    Example usage:

    # Check if a sprite touches anything if it were to be placed at (X,Y)
    contact(object1=output_grid, object2=a_sprite, x2=X, y2=Y)

    # Check if two objects touch each other

def random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=0, padding=0, padding_connectivity=8):
    """
    Find a random free location for the sprite in the grid
    Returns a tuple (x, y) of the top-left corner of the sprite in the grid, which can be passed to `blit_sprite`

    border_size: minimum distance from the edge of the grid
    background: color treated as transparent
    padding: if non-zero, the sprite will be padded with a non-background color before checking for collision
    padding_connectivity: 4 or 8, for 4-way or 8-way connectivity when padding the sprite

    Example usage:
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1, padding_connectivity=8, border_size=1, background=Color.BLACK) # find the location, using generous padding
    assert not collision(object1=grid, object2=sprite, x2=x, y2=y)
    blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)

    If no free location can be found, raises a ValueError.
    """

def object_interior(grid, background=Color.BLACK):
    """
    Computes the interior of the object (including edges)

    returns a new grid of `bool` where True indicates that the pixel is part of the object's interior.

    Example usage:
    interior = object_interior(obj, background=Color.BLACK)
    for x, y in np.argwhere(interior):
        # x,y is either inside the object or at least on its edge
    """

def random_sprite(n, m, density=0.5, symmetry=None, color_palette=None, connectivity=4, background=Color.BLACK):
    """
    Generate a sprite (an object), represented as a numpy array.

    n, m: dimensions of the sprite. If these are lists, then a random value will be chosen from the list.
    symmetry: optional type of symmetry to apply to the sprite. Can be 'horizontal', 'vertical', 'diagonal', 'radial', 'mirror', 'not_symmetric'. If None, a random symmetry type will be chosen.
    color_palette: optional list of colors to use in the sprite. If None, a random color palette will be chosen.

    Detects and extracts objects from the grid that satisfy custom specification.

    predicate: a function that takes a candidate object as input and returns True if it counts as an object
    background: color treated as transparent
    monochromatic: if True, each object is assumed to have only one color. If False, each object can include multiple colors.
    connectivity: 4 or 8, for 4-way or 8-way connectivity. If None, the connectivity is determined automatically.
    allowed_dimensions: a list of tuples (n, m) specifying the allowed dimensions of the objects. If None, objects of any size are allowed.
    colors: a list of colors that the objects are allowed to have. If None, objects of any color are allowed.

Your task is to implement the puzzle, following these steps:

1. Inspect the example puzzle implementations, making note of the functions used and the physical/geometric/topological/logical details
2. Inspect the new puzzle's description
3. Brainstorm a possible implementation for the new puzzle
4. Generate a code block formatted like the earlier examples with a comment starting `# concepts:` listing the concepts and `# description:` describing the inputs and transformation from the given description.

Be sure to make the transformation `main` deterministic. Follow the description closely.
