Here's a possible implementation for the puzzle involving obstacles and path blocking:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# path finding, obstacle avoidance, line drawing

# description:
# In the input grid, you will see several randomly colored obstacles scattered throughout the grid, along with a distinct start point and end point.
# The task is to draw a line from the start point to the end point while avoiding the obstacles. 
# The line should navigate around the obstacles and ensure no part of it overlaps with any obstacle.
# The output grid will show the line drawn from the start to the end, avoiding obstacles, while all other grid content remains unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Copy input grid to output grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    width, height = input_grid.shape

    # Identify the start and end points
    start_point = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.GREEN)[0]  # Assuming start point is marked with green
    end_point = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.RED)[0]      # Assuming end point is marked with red

    # Obstacles are any other colored pixels
    obstacle_colors = set(Color.ALL_COLORS) - {Color.GREEN, Color.RED, Color.BLACK}
    
    # Implement a simple pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A* or Dijkstra's) to find a path from start to end avoiding obstacles
    def is_valid(x, y):
        return 0 <= x < width and 0 <= y < height and input_grid[x, y] not in obstacle_colors

    from heapq import heappush, heappop
    open_set = []
    heappush(open_set, (0, start_point))
    came_from = {}
    cost_so_far = {tuple(start_point): 0}

    while open_set:
        _, current = heappop(open_set)

        if np.array_equal(current, end_point):
            break

        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            next_step = current + np.array([dx, dy])
            if is_valid(*next_step):
                new_cost = cost_so_far[tuple(current)] + 1
                if tuple(next_step) not in cost_so_far or new_cost < cost_so_far[tuple(next_step)]:
                    cost_so_far[tuple(next_step)] = new_cost
                    priority = new_cost + np.linalg.norm(next_step - end_point)
                    heappush(open_set, (priority, next_step))
                    came_from[tuple(next_step)] = current

    # Reconstruct path from end to start
    current = tuple(end_point)
    path = []
    while current in came_from:
        path.append(current)
        current = tuple(came_from[current])
    path.append(tuple(start_point))
    path.reverse()

    # Draw the path on the output grid
    for x, y in path:
        output_grid[x, y] = Color.BLUE  # Draw path in blue

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Grid dimensions
    n, m = 15, 15
    grid = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)

    # Define start and end points
    start_x, start_y = np.random.randint(0, n // 3), np.random.randint(0, m // 3)
    end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(2 * n // 3, n), np.random.randint(2 * m // 3, m)
    grid[start_x, start_y] = Color.GREEN
    grid[end_x, end_y] = Color.RED

    # Randomly scatter obstacles throughout the grid
    obstacle_density = 0.2
    randomly_scatter_points(grid, color=random.choice(list(set(Color.NOT_BLACK) - {Color.GREEN, Color.RED})), density=obstacle_density, background=Color.BLACK)

    return grid
```

This implementation uses a simplified pathfinding approach to draw a line from a start point to an end point while avoiding obstacles. The `generate_input` function creates a grid with randomly placed obstacles and designated start and end points. The `main` function calculates a path using basic pathfinding, ensuring the line avoids obstacles.
