Here is a new puzzle design based on the given description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# object identification, translation, erasure, grid manipulation

# description:
# Identify a single connected component (object) within the input grid. Determine its bounding box and erase the object by setting its pixels to the background color (0).
# Translate the object to a specified new position (row, column) by moving its bounding box to the new coordinates.
# Redraw the object at the new position, preserving its shape and color. The output grid reflects the object moved to the new location with its original position cleared.

def main(input_grid):
    # Plan:
    # 1. Find the connected component (object).
    # 2. Determine the object's bounding box.
    # 3. Erase the object by setting its pixels to the background color.
    # 4. Calculate a new random position to translate the object.
    # 5. Translate and redraw the object at the new position on the grid.

    # Find the connected component in the grid
    components = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)
    
    # Assuming only one object exists in the grid
    obj = components[0]

    # Determine the object's bounding box
    x, y, width, height = bounding_box(obj, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    # Erase the object from its original position
    input_grid[x:x+width, y:y+height] = Color.BLACK

    # Determine a new position for the object
    new_x, new_y = random_free_location_for_sprite(input_grid, crop(obj), background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1)

    # Translate and redraw the object at the new position
    translated_object = translate(obj, new_x - x, new_y - y, background=Color.BLACK)
    blit_object(input_grid, translated_object, background=Color.BLACK)

    return input_grid


def generate_input():
    # Create an empty grid with a random size between 10x10 and 20x20
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 20, size=2)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a random connected component with dimensions between 3x3 and 5x5
    width, height = np.random.randint(3, 6, size=2)
    sprite = random_sprite(width, height, density=0.7, color_palette=Color.NOT_BLACK, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Place the sprite randomly on the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
- **Concepts**: The puzzle involves identifying an object within a grid, determining its bounding box, erasing it, translating it to a new position, and redrawing it while preserving its shape and color.
  
- **Description**: The `main` function finds the single connected component in the `input_grid`, erases it by filling its bounding box with the background color, calculates a new random position for it, and redraws it at this new location. The `generate_input` function creates an input grid by placing a randomly generated sprite onto a grid. The sprite is a connected component with random dimensions and density, chosen from a set of non-black colors.
