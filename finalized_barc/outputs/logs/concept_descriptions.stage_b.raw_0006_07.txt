Let's design a new puzzle based on the given description. The puzzle involves drawing a straight line between two distinct pixels marked as start and end on a grid. This line should be drawn using pixel connectivity, and the rest of the grid should remain unchanged. Here's how we can implement this puzzle:

### Implementation

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# line drawing, pixel connectivity, grid update

# description:
# In the input, you will see a grid with two distinct pixels marked as start (green) and end (red).
# To make the output, draw a straight line connecting these two pixels using a specified color (blue).
# The line should be drawn using pixel connectivity, updating the grid by coloring each pixel along the path with the given color.
# The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Copy input grid to output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Identify the start and end positions
    start_pos = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.GREEN)[0]
    end_pos = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.RED)[0]
    
    # Extract x and y coordinates for start and end
    x1, y1 = start_pos
    x2, y2 = end_pos

    # Determine the color to draw the line
    line_color = Color.BLUE

    # Use Bresenham's line algorithm to draw a line between start and end
    dx = abs(x2 - x1)
    dy = abs(y2 - y1)
    sx = 1 if x1 < x2 else -1
    sy = 1 if y1 < y2 else -1
    err = dx - dy

    while True:
        output_grid[x1, y1] = line_color
        if x1 == x2 and y1 == y2:
            break
        e2 = 2 * err
        if e2 > -dy:
            err -= dy
            x1 += sx
        if e2 < dx:
            err += dx
            y1 += sy

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of random size
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 20, size=2)
    grid = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)

    # Randomly place start and end pixels ensuring they are not the same
    x_start, y_start = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    x_end, y_end = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    
    while x_start == x_end and y_start == y_end:
        x_end, y_end = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)

    # Set the start and end positions on the grid
    grid[x_start, y_start] = Color.GREEN
    grid[x_end, y_end] = Color.RED

    return grid
```

### Explanation

- **Concepts**:
  - The puzzle involves drawing a straight line using pixel connectivity on a grid.
  
- **Description**:
  - The input is a grid with two distinct pixels marked as the start (green) and end (red).
  - The task is to draw a straight line connecting these two pixels using a specified color (blue).
  - The line is drawn using pixel connectivity, and the rest of the grid remains unchanged.
  
- **Implementation Details**:
  - The `main` function reads the start and end positions and draws a line using Bresenham's algorithm, which is efficient and suitable for drawing a straight line between two points on a grid.
  - The `generate_input` function creates a grid with randomly placed start and end points, ensuring they are distinct.

This puzzle challenges students to think about line drawing algorithms and how to work with grids programmatically.
