To implement the puzzle based on the given description, we need to break down the task into manageable parts and utilize the provided library functions. Here's a step-by-step approach to design the puzzle:

1. **Identify the Guide Object:** We need to uniquely identify a guide object based on a distinct attribute, such as color or size. For simplicity, let's assume the guide object is uniquely identified by having a specific color that no other object has in the grid.

2. **Determine the Anchor Point:** Once the guide object is identified, determine an anchor point, such as the centroid or top-left corner of the guide object. We'll use the `object_position` function for this purpose.

3. **Count Enclosed Regions (Holes):** Starting from the anchor point of the guide object, count the number of enclosed regions (holes) in the grid. A hole is defined as a fully enclosed black region inside the grid.

4. **Output the Count of Holes:** The output should be a grid with the same size as the input, with the count of the holes originating from the guide's position marked in a distinctive way, for example, by placing the count in a specific location on the grid.

Let's implement the puzzle:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, unique selection, anchor point, hole counting

# description:
# In the input grid, there is a uniquely colored guide object. The task is to identify this guide object, find its anchor point, 
# and then count the number of enclosed regions (holes) in the grid from this anchor point. The output should display the count of these holes.

def main(input_grid):
    # Step 1: Identify the guide object
    # Assume the guide object is uniquely colored. Find the color that appears in only one object.
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)
    
    # Determine the unique color for the guide object
    color_count = {}
    for obj in objects:
        color = np.unique(obj[obj != Color.BLACK])[0]
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    
    guide_color = next(color for color, count in color_count.items() if count == 1)
    guide_object = next(obj for obj in objects if np.any(obj == guide_color))

    # Step 2: Determine the anchor point of the guide object
    anchor_x, anchor_y = object_position(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK, anchor="center")

    # Step 3: Count the number of enclosed regions (holes) in the grid
    # We will consider enclosed black regions that are not part of the background
    hole_count = 0
    for obj in objects:
        if np.all(obj == Color.BLACK):
            interior_mask = object_interior(obj, background=Color.BLACK)
            if np.any(interior_mask):
                hole_count += 1

    # Step 4: Output the count of holes
    # Create an output grid and place the count in a specific location, e.g., at the top-left corner
    output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, Color.BLACK)
    output_grid[0, 0] = hole_count  # Place the count in the top-left corner

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a random grid with various objects and exactly one uniquely colored guide object
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 15, size=2)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Add random objects to the grid
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        sprite = random_sprite(np.random.randint(2, 5), np.random.randint(2, 5), color_palette=list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
        x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1, border_size=1)
        blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)

    # Add a uniquely colored guide object
    unique_color = np.random.choice([c for c in Color.NOT_BLACK if not np.any(grid == c)])
    guide_sprite = random_sprite(np.random.randint(2, 4), np.random.randint(2, 4), color_palette=[unique_color])
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, padding=1, border_size=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, x, y)

    return grid
```

This implementation captures the essence of the puzzle, where the main task is to identify a unique guide object, determine an anchor point, and count the enclosed regions (holes) from that point. The `generate_input` function creates a grid with random objects and a uniquely colored guide object, ensuring the puzzle is solvable and interesting each time it's run.
