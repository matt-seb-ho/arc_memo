Here is the implementation of the puzzle as per the given description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
import random
from typing import *


# concepts:
# window processing, predicate check, conditional fill, grid manipulation

# description:
# Input is a grid with specific 3x3 window coordinates and a predicate function. 
# For each cell within the specified 3x3 window, check if it satisfies the predicate. 
# If a cell does not satisfy the predicate, replace its value with a specified fill_value. 
# Cells that satisfy the predicate remain unchanged. This operation completes the pattern 
# within the window by filling only the non-matching cells.

def main(input_grid: np.ndarray, window_coords: Tuple[int, int], predicate: Callable[[int], bool], fill_value: int) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Apply the specified transformation to the input grid.
    """
    # Extract the specified 3x3 window from the input grid
    x, y = window_coords
    window = input_grid[x:x+3, y:y+3]

    # Process each cell in the window and apply the predicate
    for i in range(window.shape[0]):
        for j in range(window.shape[1]):
            if not predicate(window[i, j]):
                window[i, j] = fill_value

    # Update the grid with the transformed window
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    output_grid[x:x+3, y:y+3] = window

    return output_grid

def generate_input() -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Tuple[int, int], Callable[[int], bool], int]:
    """
    Generate a new input for the puzzle including the grid, window coordinates, predicate function, and fill value.
    """
    # Create a grid with random colors
    grid_size = random.randint(6, 10)  # Ensure the grid is large enough for at least one 3x3 window
    grid = np.random.choice(list(Color.ALL_COLORS), size=(grid_size, grid_size))

    # Choose random coordinates for a 3x3 window
    x = random.randint(0, grid_size - 3)
    y = random.randint(0, grid_size - 3)
    window_coords = (x, y)

    predicate = lambda color: color != Color.BLACK

    # Choose a random fill value (different from black)

### Explanation

- **Concepts**: The puzzle focuses on processing a 3x3 window within a grid, evaluating cells against a predicate, and conditionally filling cells that do not satisfy the predicate with a specified value.

- **`main` Function**: This function accepts an input grid, coordinates for a 3x3 window, a predicate function, and a fill value. It processes each cell within the window, replacing any cell that does not satisfy the predicate with the fill value, and returns the updated grid.

- **`generate_input` Function**: This function generates a random grid with a specified size, selects random coordinates for a 3x3 window, defines a simple predicate (e.g., checking if the color is not black), and chooses a fill value. These are returned as inputs for the `main` function. 

This puzzle is designed to help middle-schoolers understand concepts like grid manipulation, window processing, and conditional logic.
