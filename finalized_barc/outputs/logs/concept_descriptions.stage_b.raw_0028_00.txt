To implement the puzzle for detecting and normalizing the orientation of a pointer-shaped object, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Generate Input:**
   - Create a grid with a single pointer-shaped object on a background.
   - Randomly choose the size, shape, and orientation of the pointer.

2. **Determine Pointer's Orientation:**
   - Find the pointer object in the grid using connected components.
   - Calculate the centroid of the pointer.
   - Identify the tip of the pointer (usually the most extreme point in a certain direction).
   - Compute the vector from the centroid to the tip to determine its orientation.

3. **Normalize Orientation:**
   - Rotate and/or flip the pointer to match a canonical orientation (e.g., pointing upwards).
   - Quantize the direction into one of the cardinal directions (N, S, E, W).

4. **Implement `main` and `generate_input`:**
    - `main`: Perform the transformation and output the determined direction.
    - `generate_input`: Create random pointer-shaped objects and place them on the grid.

Here is the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# orientation detection, shape normalization, centroid-to-tip vector, direction quantization

# description:
# Input is a grid containing a single pointer-shaped object on a background. Normalize the pointer by rotating and/or flipping it to match a canonical orientation.
# Determine the pointer's facing direction by computing the vector from its centroid to its tip and quantizing this vector to one of the cardinal directions (N, S, E, W).
# Output the determined direction as a label.

def main(input_grid):
    # Copy the input grid to the output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Find the pointer object in the input grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)
    assert len(objects) == 1  # Ensure there is only one object
    pointer = objects[0]

    # Compute the centroid of the pointer
    pointer_pixels = np.argwhere(pointer != Color.BLACK)
    centroid = np.mean(pointer_pixels, axis=0)

    # Determine the tip of the pointer (farthest from the centroid)
    distances = np.linalg.norm(pointer_pixels - centroid, axis=1)
    tip_index = np.argmax(distances)
    tip_location = pointer_pixels[tip_index]

    # Compute the vector from centroid to the tip
    vector = tip_location - centroid

    # Quantize the vector to one of the cardinal directions
    if abs(vector[0]) > abs(vector[1]):
        direction = 'E' if vector[0] > 0 else 'W'
    else:
        direction = 'S' if vector[1] > 0 else 'N'

    # Return the direction
    return direction

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with random dimensions
    width, height = np.random.randint(5, 15, size=2)
    input_grid = np.full((width, height), Color.BLACK)

    # Choose a random color for the pointer
    pointer_color = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)

    # Generate a pointer-shaped sprite
    pointer_length = np.random.randint(3, min(width, height) // 2)
    pointer_sprite = np.full((pointer_length, pointer_length), pointer_color)
    tip_index = np.random.choice([(0, pointer_length - 1), (pointer_length - 1, 0), 
                                  (pointer_length - 1, pointer_length - 1), (0, 0)])
    pointer_sprite[tip_index] = Color.BLACK

    # Place the pointer in a random location on the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(input_grid, pointer_sprite, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(input_grid, pointer_sprite, x, y)

    return input_grid
```

This implementation detects the orientation of a pointer object on a grid and determines its facing direction. The `generate_input` function creates random pointer shapes to test the transformation.
