# description:
# Input is a grid containing a single pointer-shaped object on a background. Normalize the pointer by rotating and/or flipping it to match a canonical orientation.
# Determine the pointer's facing direction by computing the vector from its centroid to its tip and quantizing this vector to one of the cardinal directions (N, S, E, W).
# Output the determined direction as a label.

This implementation follows the provided puzzle description closely. The `main` function identifies the pointer's direction by calculating the vector from its centroid to its tip, then quantizes this vector to the nearest cardinal direction. The `generate_input` function creates a random grid with a single pointer-shaped object oriented in a random direction.
