Here's a puzzle based on the guide object concept, where a distinct colored object acts as a guide or starting point for a transformation. The transformation will involve expanding the guide object in a specific direction based on its position in the grid.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, position-based transformation, expansion

# description:
# In the input grid, there is a uniquely colored guide object (e.g., teal), which will act as the starting point.
# The task is to expand this guide object in a specific direction determined by its position: 
# - If it's in the top half of the grid, expand upwards.
# - If it's in the bottom half, expand downwards.
# - If it's in the left half, expand leftwards.
# - If it's in the right half, expand rightwards.
# The expansion continues until it hits another object or the edge of the grid.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find the guide object based on its unique color
    guide_color = Color.TEAL
    guide_object = detect_objects(input_grid, colors=[guide_color], monochromatic=True, connectivity=8)[0]
    
    # Determine the position of the guide object
    x, y, width, height = bounding_box(guide_object)
    grid_height, grid_width = input_grid.shape
    
    # Decide the direction based on the position of the guide object
    direction = None
    if y + height / 2 < grid_height / 2:
        direction = 'up'
    elif y + height / 2 >= grid_height / 2:
        direction = 'down'
    elif x + width / 2 < grid_width / 2:
        direction = 'left'
    elif x + width / 2 >= grid_width / 2:
        direction = 'right'

    # Create the output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Perform the expansion in the chosen direction
    if direction == 'up':
        for i in range(y, -1, -1):
            if np.any(input_grid[i, x:x+width] != Color.BLACK):
                break
            output_grid[i, x:x+width] = guide_color
    elif direction == 'down':
        for i in range(y + height, grid_height):
            if np.any(input_grid[i, x:x+width] != Color.BLACK):
                break
            output_grid[i, x:x+width] = guide_color
    elif direction == 'left':
        for i in range(x, -1, -1):
            if np.any(input_grid[y:y+height, i] != Color.BLACK):
                break
            output_grid[y:y+height, i] = guide_color
    elif direction == 'right':
        for i in range(x + width, grid_width):
            if np.any(input_grid[y:y+height, i] != Color.BLACK):
                break
            output_grid[y:y+height, i] = guide_color

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid with a random size
    n, m = np.random.randint(5, 10), np.random.randint(5, 10)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Place the guide object (teal) at a random position
    guide_sprite = np.full((1, 1), Color.TEAL)
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, border_size=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, x, y)

    # Optionally add random objects to the grid
    num_objects = np.random.randint(1, 4)
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        obj_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.ALL_COLORS - {Color.TEAL, Color.BLACK}))
        obj_sprite = random_sprite(2, 2, color_palette=[obj_color], symmetry='not_symmetric')
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, obj_sprite, border_size=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, obj_sprite, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            continue

    return grid
```

In this puzzle, the guide object (teal) determines the starting point for the transformation. Depending on its position in the grid, it expands in a specific direction until it encounters another object or the grid's edge. This puzzle tests the student's understanding of spatial reasoning and object manipulation based on initial conditions.
