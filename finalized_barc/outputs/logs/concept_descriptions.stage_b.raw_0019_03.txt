Here's the implementation for the new puzzle based on the provided description. The puzzle involves identifying a unique colored object and transforming the grid to highlight this object:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# unique color identification, guide object selection, connected components

# description:
# The input consists of multiple distinct objects on a grid, each with a unique color. 
# Identify the guide object as the one whose color is not shared by any other object in the grid. 
# The output is a transformation where the guide object is selected based on its unique color, while all other objects remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Detect all the objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, monochromatic=True, connectivity=8, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Determine the colors of each object
    color_count = {}
    for obj in objects:
        colors = object_colors(obj, background=Color.BLACK)
        for color in colors:
            if color not in color_count:
                color_count[color] = 0
            color_count[color] += 1

    # Find the unique colored object
    unique_color = None
    for color, count in color_count.items():
        if count == 1:
            unique_color = color
            break

    # Create a copy of the input grid for the output
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Highlight the unique object by changing its color to a specific highlight color (e.g., TEAL)
    highlight_color = Color.TEAL
    for obj in objects:
        if unique_color in object_colors(obj, background=Color.BLACK):
            mask = obj != Color.BLACK
            output_grid[mask] = highlight_color

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid with random objects, each with a unique color
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 15), np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # List of possible colors
    colors = list(Color.NOT_BLACK)

    # Randomly shuffle colors to ensure uniqueness
    np.random.shuffle(colors)

    # Determine how many objects to create
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, min(8, len(colors)))

    # Generate and place objects on the grid
    for i in range(num_objects):
        color = colors.pop()  # Use a unique color for each object
        sprite = random_sprite(n=[2, 3, 4], m=[2, 3, 4], color_palette=[color], connectivity=8)
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            continue  # If no space is available, skip this sprite

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

- **Concepts**: The puzzle revolves around identifying unique colors among objects in a grid and using this property to highlight the guide object.
  
- **Description**: The `main` function identifies the guide object by searching for the object with a unique color. It transforms the grid by changing the color of this unique object while leaving all other objects unchanged. The `generate_input` function creates a grid with several objects, each having a unique color, ensuring the puzzle can always be solved by the procedure in `main`.

- **Implementation Details**:
  - `find_connected_components` is used to detect all objects in the grid.
  - A dictionary `color_count` is used to track the occurrence of each color.
  - The guide object is highlighted using a predefined highlight color (TEAL) to distinguish it from other objects.
  - `generate_input` ensures a unique color for each object by using a shuffled list of colors.
