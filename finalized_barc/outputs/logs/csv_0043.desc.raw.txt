```python
# concepts: boolean mask, predicate evaluation, pattern recognition, template creation
# description: Input is a grid region (block) and a predicate function. Evaluate the predicate at each cell in the block to produce a boolean mask, where each mask cell is True if the predicate is satisfied at that location, otherwise False. This mask serves as a reusable template for identifying the pattern in other grid regions.
