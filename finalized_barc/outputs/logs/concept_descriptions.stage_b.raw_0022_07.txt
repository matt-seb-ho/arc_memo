Let's create a new puzzle that involves identifying a sequence of transformations applied to a set of colored shapes over several timesteps. The goal is to extrapolate the pattern or transformation and generate the next grid in the sequence.

**Concepts**: pattern extrapolation, sequence prediction, shape transformation, color change

**Description**: 
Input consists of a sequence of grids representing consecutive time steps, where objects (colored shapes) exhibit a consistent transformation pattern in terms of position, shape, or color. Analyze the sequence to identify the evolving pattern, such as linear movement, rotation, scaling, or color transition. Extrapolate the identified pattern to predict and generate the next grid in the sequence. The output is a single grid that continues the detected pattern logically from the last input grid.

Here is the implementation of the puzzle:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# pattern extrapolation, sequence prediction, shape transformation, color change

# description:
# Input consists of a sequence of grids representing consecutive time steps, where objects (colored shapes) exhibit a consistent transformation pattern in terms of position, shape, or color. Analyze the sequence to identify the evolving pattern, such as linear movement, rotation, scaling, or color transition. Extrapolate the identified pattern to predict and generate the next grid in the sequence. The output is a single grid that continues the detected pattern logically from the last input grid.

def main(input_grids: List[np.ndarray]) -> np.ndarray:
    # Analyze the sequence of input grids to determine the transformation pattern
    num_grids = len(input_grids)
    assert num_grids >= 2, "There should be at least two grids to determine the pattern"

    # Assume all grids are of the same size
    grid_shape = input_grids[0].shape
    output_grid = np.full(grid_shape, Color.BLACK)

    # Extract the objects from the last two grids
    objects_prev = find_connected_components(input_grids[-2], monochromatic=True, background=Color.BLACK)
    objects_last = find_connected_components(input_grids[-1], monochromatic=True, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Determine the transformation pattern
    for obj_prev, obj_last in zip(objects_prev, objects_last):
        # Get positions and colors
        x_prev, y_prev = object_position(obj_prev)
        x_last, y_last = object_position(obj_last)
        color = object_colors(obj_last)[0]
        
        # Calculate the movement vector (dx, dy)
        dx, dy = x_last - x_prev, y_last - y_prev

        # Extrapolate the next position
        x_next, y_next = x_last + dx, y_last + dy

        # Ensure the next position is within bounds
        if 0 <= x_next < grid_shape[0] and 0 <= y_next < grid_shape[1]:
            # Blit the object to the next position in the output grid
            blit_sprite(output_grid, obj_last, x=x_next, y=y_next, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid

def generate_input() -> List[np.ndarray]:
    # Generate a sequence of grids with a consistent transformation pattern
    num_grids = np.random.randint(3, 5)
    grid_shape = (10, 10)
    grids = [np.full(grid_shape, Color.BLACK) for _ in range(num_grids)]

    # Randomly choose the number and color of objects
    num_objects = np.random.randint(1, 4)
    colors = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), size=num_objects, replace=False)

    for i in range(num_objects):
        # Randomly initialize the shape and position of the object
        size = np.random.randint(1, 3)
        sprite = np.full((size, size), colors[i])
        x, y = np.random.randint(0, grid_shape[0] - size), np.random.randint(0, grid_shape[1] - size)
        
        # Apply a consistent transformation across grids
        dx, dy = np.random.choice([-1, 0, 1], size=2)  # Movement vector

        for t in range(num_grids):
            # Place the object on the grid
            grids[t] = blit_sprite(grids[t], sprite, x=x + t*dx, y=y + t*dy, background=Color.BLACK)

    return grids
```

**Explanation**:

- **Main Function**: Analyzes the sequence of input grids to determine the pattern of transformation (movement) of each object and applies that transformation to predict the next grid in the sequence.
- **Generate Input**: Creates a sequence of grids where a set of objects are transformed consistently according to a random movement vector. This function ensures that each run generates a new set of sequences, providing variety for the puzzle solver.
