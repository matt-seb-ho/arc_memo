Certainly! Let's implement the puzzle based on the given description:

### Puzzle Overview

**Concepts:**
- Specific color selection
- Connected components
- Filtering

**Description:**
The input consists of a grid containing multiple objects of various colors. The task is to identify and select all objects composed entirely of a specified target color. The output should be a grid where only these selected objects are preserved in their original positions and colors, while all other grid cells are set to the background color (black).

Here is the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# specific color selection, connected components, filtering

# description:
# The input consists of multiple objects of various colors on a grid.
# Identify and select all objects that are composed entirely of a specified target color.
# Output a grid where only these selected objects are preserved in their original positions and colors, while all other grid cells are set to background color (0).

def main(input_grid, target_color):
    # Find all connected components with monochromatic=True
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)

    # Create an output grid initialized with the background color
    output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, Color.BLACK)

    # Filter out objects that match the target color and blit them onto the output grid
    for obj in objects:
        if np.any(obj == target_color):  # Check if the object is composed of the target color
            output_grid = blit_object(output_grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a random grid size between 10x10 and 15x15
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 16), np.random.randint(10, 16)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Choose a random target color from available colors
    target_color = random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))

    # Place several objects of various colors in the grid
    num_objects = np.random.randint(5, 10)
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        obj_color = random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
        obj = random_sprite(n=np.random.randint(1, 4), m=np.random.randint(1, 4), color_palette=[obj_color])
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, obj, padding=1, border_size=1)
            grid = blit_sprite(grid, obj, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            continue

    # Ensure at least one object of the target color is placed
    obj = random_sprite(n=np.random.randint(1, 4), m=np.random.randint(1, 4), color_palette=[target_color])
    try:
        x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, obj, padding=1, border_size=1)
        grid = blit_sprite(grid, obj, x, y)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    return grid, target_color
```

### Explanation:

- **`main` Function:**
  - Finds all monochromatic objects in the grid.
  - Filters objects based on the `target_color`.
  - Constructs an output grid, blitting only the objects with the target color onto it.

- **`generate_input` Function:**
  - Generates a grid of size between 10x10 and 15x15.
  - Randomly selects a target color.
  - Populates the grid with random color objects, ensuring at least one object is of the target color.

This implementation provides a deterministic transformation in `main` and a stochastic example generator in `generate_input`.
