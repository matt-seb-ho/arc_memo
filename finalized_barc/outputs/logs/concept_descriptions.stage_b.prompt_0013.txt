You are a puzzle maker designing geometric, physical, and topological puzzles for curious middle-schoolers.

Each puzzle consists of uncovering a deterministic rule, pattern, procedure, algorithm, or transformation law that maps inputs to outputs.
Both the inputs and outputs are 2D grids of colored pixels. There are 10 colors, but the order of the colors is never relevant to the puzzle.

The middle schoolers are trying to discover this deterministic transformation, which can be implemented as a Python function called `main`.
Designing a puzzle involves also creating example inputs, which can be implemented as a Python function called `generate_input`. Unlike `main`, the `generate_input` function should be stochastic, so that every time you run it, you get another good example of what the transformation can be applied to.

Here is a overview of the puzzle you are designing:

Concepts: 
holes, enclosed regions, flood-fill, connected components

Description: 
Input consists of a grid with a single object enclosing empty spaces (holes). Identify holes as background-color (0) regions fully enclosed by the object, not touching the grid border. Use flood-fill from the border to exclude non-enclosed regions. Output the grid with holes marked or filled by a target object or color, while preserving the enclosing object and other non-hole regions.

Please implement the puzzle by writing code containing the `generate_input` and `main` functions. Use the following standard library (`common.py`):

```python
def draw_line(grid, x, y, end_x=None, end_y=None, length=None, direction=None, color=None, stop_at_color=[]):
    """
    Draws a line starting at (x, y) extending to (end_x, end_y) or of the specified length in the specified direction
    Direction should be a vector with elements -1, 0, or 1.
    If length is None, then the line will continue until it hits the edge of the grid.

    stop_at_color: optional list of colors that the line should stop at. If the line hits a pixel of one of these colors, it will stop.

    Returns the endpoint of the line.

    Example:
    # blue diagonal line from (0, 0) to (2, 2)
    stop_x, stop_y = draw_line(grid, 0, 0, length=3, color=blue, direction=(1, 1))
    draw_line(grid, 0, 0, end_x=2, end_y=2, color=blue)
    assert (stop_x, stop_y) == (2, 2)
    """

def find_connected_components(grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=4, monochromatic=True):
    """
    Find the connected components in the grid. Returns a list of connected components, where each connected component is a numpy array.

    connectivity: 4 or 8, for 4-way or 8-way connectivity.
    monochromatic: if True, each connected component is assumed to have only one color. If False, each connected component can include multiple colors.
    """

def blit(grid, sprite, x=0, y=0, background=None):
    """
    Copies the sprite into the grid at the specified location. Modifies the grid in place.

    background: color treated as transparent. If specified, only copies the non-background pixels of the sprite.
    """

def blit_object(grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK):
    """
    Draws an object onto the grid using its current location.

    Example usage:
    blit_object(output_grid, an_object, background=background_color)
    """

def blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y, background=Color.BLACK):
