Certainly! Let's implement the puzzle based on the given description. Here's the implementation for normalizing a pointer-shaped object and determining its facing direction by quantizing the centroid-to-tip vector.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# orientation detection, shape normalization, centroid-to-tip vector, direction quantization

# description:
# Input is a grid containing a single pointer-shaped object on a background. Normalize the pointer by rotating and/or flipping it to match a canonical orientation.
# Determine the pointer's facing direction by computing the vector from its centroid to its tip and quantizing this vector to one of the cardinal directions (N, S, E, W).
# Output the determined direction as a label.

def main(input_grid):
    # Copy the input grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # Find the pointer object
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8)

    # There should be only one object in the grid
    assert len(objects) == 1
    pointer_obj = objects[0]

    # Crop the object to extract the sprite
    pointer_sprite = crop(pointer_obj)

    # Compute the centroid of the pointer object
    non_black_pixels = np.argwhere(pointer_sprite != Color.BLACK)
    centroid = np.mean(non_black_pixels, axis=0)

    # Identify the tip of the pointer (the furthest point from the centroid)
    tip_idx = np.argmax(np.linalg.norm(non_black_pixels - centroid, axis=1))
    tip = non_black_pixels[tip_idx]

    # Compute the vector from the centroid to the tip
    vector = tip - centroid

    # Quantize this vector to one of the cardinal directions (N, S, E, W)
    # We'll map the vector to the closest cardinal direction
    directions = {
        'N': np.array([-1, 0]),
        'S': np.array([1, 0]),
        'E': np.array([0, 1]),
        'W': np.array([0, -1])
    }

    # Normalize the vector to unit length
    unit_vector = vector / np.linalg.norm(vector)

    # Determine the closest direction by comparing dot products
    closest_direction = max(directions, key=lambda d: np.dot(unit_vector, directions[d]))

    # Output the determined direction
    return closest_direction

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of size 10x10 with a black background
    grid = np.full((10, 10), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a random pointer-shaped sprite
    pointer_sprite = random_sprite(3, 3, density=0.7, color_palette=[np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)], connectivity=8)

    # Find a random free location for the sprite on the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, pointer_sprite, border_size=1)

    # Place the sprite onto the grid
    blit_sprite(grid, pointer_sprite, x, y)

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
- **Concepts**: We focus on shape normalization and orientation detection by determining the centroid-to-tip vector and quantizing it to cardinal directions.
- **Description**: The input is a grid with a single pointer-shaped object. The task is to normalize the pointer and determine its facing direction by analyzing the vector from the centroid to its tip.
- **`main` Function**: We use `find_connected_components` to identify the pointer, find its centroid and tip, compute the vector, and then determine the closest cardinal direction.
- **`generate_input` Function**: We generate a random grid with a pointer-shaped object by creating a sprite and placing it randomly in the grid.
