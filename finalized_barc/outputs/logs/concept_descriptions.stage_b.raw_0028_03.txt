Here's an implementation of the puzzle based on the provided description. 

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# orientation detection, shape normalization, centroid-to-tip vector, direction quantization

# description:
# In the input, you will see a grid containing a single pointer-shaped object on a background. Normalize the pointer by rotating and/or flipping it to match a canonical orientation. 
# Determine the pointer's facing direction by computing the vector from its centroid to its tip and quantizing this vector to one of the cardinal directions (N, S, E, W). 
# Output the determined direction as a label.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find the background color, assuming it is the most common color
    background_color = np.bincount(input_grid.flatten()).argmax()

    # Find the single pointer-shaped object in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=background_color, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)
    assert len(objects) == 1
    pointer_object = objects[0]

    # Crop the object to extract its sprite
    pointer_sprite = crop(pointer_object, background=background_color)

    # Calculate the centroid of the pointer object
    non_background_pixels = np.argwhere(pointer_sprite != background_color)
    centroid = non_background_pixels.mean(axis=0)

    # Assume the tip of the pointer is the farthest point from the centroid
    distances = np.linalg.norm(non_background_pixels - centroid, axis=1)
    tip_index = np.argmax(distances)
    tip = non_background_pixels[tip_index]

    # Compute the vector from the centroid to the tip
    vector = tip - centroid

    # Quantize the vector to one of the cardinal directions
    cardinal_directions = {
        (0, -1): "N",  # North
        (0, 1): "S",   # South
        (-1, 0): "W",  # West
        (1, 0): "E"    # East
    }

    # Determine which cardinal direction is closest
    direction = max(cardinal_directions.keys(), key=lambda d: np.dot(d, vector))
    direction_label = cardinal_directions[direction]

    # Return the direction as a label
    return direction_label

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with a random size
    grid_size = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    grid = np.zeros((grid_size, grid_size), dtype=int)

    # Choose a random color for the pointer
    pointer_color = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)

    # Generate a random pointer-shaped object
    pointer_shape = random_sprite(n=[3, 4, 5], m=[3, 4, 5], density=0.8, color_palette=[pointer_color], connectivity=8)

    # Place the pointer randomly on the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, pointer_shape, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, pointer_shape, x, y)

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **`main` Function:**
   - The function first identifies the background color and extracts the pointer object from the grid.
   - It computes the centroid of the pointer object and determines its tip by finding the farthest point from the centroid.
   - A vector from the centroid to the tip is calculated and quantized to one of the cardinal directions (N, S, E, W).
   - It outputs the direction as a label.

2. **`generate_input` Function:**
   - A grid is generated with a random size, and a pointer-shaped object is created using a random sprite generator.
   - The pointer is placed randomly within the grid, ensuring a non-collision with the edges using padding. 

This setup allows middle-schoolers to understand orientation detection, shape normalization, and vector quantization concepts.
