Below is the implementation of the puzzle based on the provided description. The puzzle involves identifying a unique guide object based on its unique color among other connected components. Here's the complete code:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# unique color selection, connected components, guide object identification

# description:
# The input grid contains various connected components of different colors.
# Among all components, identify the guide object which has a unique color that no other object shares.
# The output grid should only contain this guide object, with all other components ignored.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all connected components in the input grid
    components = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)

    # Count the occurrences of each color among all components
    color_count = {}
    for component in components:
        color = np.unique(component[component != Color.BLACK])[0]
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1

    # Identify the unique color that appears only once
    unique_color = None
    for color, count in color_count.items():
        if count == 1:
            unique_color = color
            break

    # Find the guide object with the unique color
    guide_object = None
    for component in components:
        if np.any(component == unique_color):
            guide_object = component
            break

    # Create an output grid and place the guide object onto it
    output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, Color.BLACK)
    if guide_object is not None:
        blit_object(output_grid, guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a random grid size between 10x10 and 15x15
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 16), np.random.randint(10, 16)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Determine the number of components to generate
    num_components = np.random.randint(3, 6)

    # Generate random components with random colors
    colors = list(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    np.random.shuffle(colors)

    for i in range(num_components):
        # Create a random sprite
        sprite_size = np.random.randint(3, 5)
        sprite = random_sprite(n=sprite_size, m=sprite_size, color_palette=[colors[i]], connectivity=8)

        try:
            # Place the sprite onto the grid
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1, border_size=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            # If unable to place, retry with a new sprite
            continue

    # Ensure there is one guide object with a unique color
    unique_color = colors[num_components - 1]
    sprite = random_sprite(n=3, m=3, color_palette=[unique_color], connectivity=8)
    try:
        x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1, border_size=1)
        blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)
    except ValueError:
        return generate_input()

    return grid
```

### Key Details:
- **Concepts**: The puzzle involves selecting the unique color among connected components and identifying the guide object based on this color.
- **Description**: The input is a grid with connected components of various colors. The output should be a grid with only the guide object, which is the only component with a unique color.
