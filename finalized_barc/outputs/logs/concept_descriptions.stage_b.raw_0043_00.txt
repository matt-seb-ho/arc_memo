Let's create a new puzzle based on the concepts of boolean masks, predicate evaluation, pattern recognition, and template creation. We'll use the provided common functions to generate the puzzle.

### Puzzle Description

**Concepts:** boolean mask, predicate evaluation, pattern recognition, template creation

**Description:** 
The input is a grid region (block) and a predicate function. Evaluate the predicate at each cell in the block to produce a boolean mask, where each mask cell is True if the predicate is satisfied at that location, otherwise False. This mask serves as a reusable template for identifying the pattern in other grid regions.

Here's how we can implement this puzzle:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# boolean mask, predicate evaluation, pattern recognition, template creation

# description:
# Input is a grid region (block) and a predicate function. Evaluate the predicate at each cell in the block to produce a boolean mask,
# where each mask cell is True if the predicate is satisfied at that location, otherwise False. This mask serves as a reusable template
# for identifying the pattern in other grid regions.

def main(input_grid):
    # Define a simple predicate function for demonstration.
    # This predicate returns True if the color is not black.
    def predicate(color):
        return color != Color.BLACK

    # Initialize an output grid with the same shape as the input grid
    output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, Color.BLACK)

    # Evaluate the predicate function on each cell of the input grid
    mask = np.vectorize(predicate)(input_grid)

    # Fill the corresponding cells in the output grid with a color (e.g., yellow) where the mask is True
    output_grid[mask] = Color.YELLOW

    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Generate a random grid size
    n, m = np.random.randint(5, 15), np.random.randint(5, 15)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Randomly scatter a few colors into the grid
    num_colors = np.random.randint(1, 5)
    colors = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), num_colors, replace=False)

    for color in colors:
        randomly_scatter_points(grid, color=color, density=0.3)

    return grid
```

### Explanation

- **Predicate Function:** We define a simple predicate function that checks if a cell's color is not black. This is a placeholder and can be replaced with any logical condition.
  
- **Boolean Mask:** Using `np.vectorize`, we apply the predicate to each cell in the input grid to produce a boolean mask.

- **Output Grid:** We create an output grid of the same size as the input grid. For each `True` value in the mask, we set the corresponding cell in the output grid to a specific color (e.g., yellow), highlighting the pattern identified by the predicate.

- **Input Generation:** The `generate_input` function creates a grid filled with black and randomly scatters some non-black colors. This provides a varied input to test the pattern recognition and template creation.

This puzzle encourages students to understand how predicates can be used to identify patterns and how boolean masks can simplify complex tasks in grid transformations.
