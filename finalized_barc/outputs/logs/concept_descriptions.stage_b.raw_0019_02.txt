Here's an implementation of the puzzle described, where we identify a guide object based on its unique color and transform the grid accordingly:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# unique color identification, guide object selection, connected components

# description:
# The input consists of multiple distinct objects on a grid, each with a unique color.
# Identify the guide object as the one whose color is not shared by any other object in the grid.
# The output is a transformation where the guide object is selected based on its unique color, while all other objects remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)

    # Count occurrences of each color in the grid
    color_count = {}
    for obj in objects:
        color = object_colors(obj, background=Color.BLACK)[0]
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1

    # Identify the unique color that appears only once
    unique_color = None
    for color, count in color_count.items():
        if count == 1:
            unique_color = color
            break
    
    # Create a copy of the input grid for the output
    output_grid = np.full_like(input_grid, Color.BLACK)

    # Find and copy the guide object with the unique color to the output grid
    for obj in objects:
        obj_color = object_colors(obj, background=Color.BLACK)[0]
        if obj_color == unique_color:
            blit_object(output_grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK)
            break

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Random grid size
    width, height = np.random.randint(10, 15), np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((width, height), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a set of unique colors for the objects
    n_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    colors = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), size=n_objects, replace=False)

    # Place objects with unique colors on the grid
    for color in colors:
        sprite = random_sprite(np.random.randint(2, 4), np.random.randint(2, 4), color_palette=[color])
        x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1, padding=1)
        blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)

    return grid
```

### Explanation

1. **Concepts**:
   - **Unique Color Identification**: The task is to find an object whose color is unique among all objects in the grid.
   - **Guide Object Selection**: The guide object is the one with the unique color.
   - **Connected Components**: The grid contains disjoint colored objects.

2. **Description**:
   - The `main` function processes the input grid to identify the unique colored guide object and outputs a grid highlighting only that object.
   - The `generate_input` function creates a grid with randomly placed objects, each having a unique color.

3. **Implementation**:
   - We use `find_connected_components` to detect all objects.
   - We count the occurrences of each color using a dictionary to identify the unique color.
   - The output grid is formed by copying only the guide object (with the unique color) onto a blank grid.
   - The `generate_input` function creates a grid of random size with a few objects each having a unique color, ensuring there's always a guide object in the test grid.
