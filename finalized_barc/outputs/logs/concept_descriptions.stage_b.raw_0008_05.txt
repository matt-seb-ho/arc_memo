Here is a possible implementation for your puzzle:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# recolor, connected components, color scheme

# description:
# The input grid contains several objects of different colors.
# The task is to find a single connected component (object) and recolor it using a specified color scheme.
# The color scheme may be a single color or a function that determines the color based on object properties.
# All other grid elements remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all connected components in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=4, monochromatic=True)
    
    # Copy the input grid to the output grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    
    # Pick a random object from the list of connected components to recolor
    random_object = objects[np.random.randint(len(objects))]
    
    # Define the color scheme (e.g., change the object's color to GREEN)
    new_color = Color.GREEN
    
    # Apply the color scheme to the selected object
    random_object[random_object != Color.BLACK] = new_color
    
    # Blit the recolored object back onto the output grid
    blit_object(output_grid, random_object, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of random size between 10 and 20
    n = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    input_grid = np.full((n, n), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Generate random objects and place them onto the grid
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        obj = random_sprite(n=[3, 4, 5], m=[3, 4, 5], color_palette=list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(input_grid, obj, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(input_grid, obj, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
        except ValueError:
            continue
            
    return input_grid
```

### Explanation:

- **Concepts**: The puzzle involves identifying connected components (objects) within a grid and applying a color scheme to recolor a selected object.
  
- **Description**: 
  - The `main` function first identifies all connected components in the input grid. 
  - It then selects a random object to apply a predetermined color scheme (in this case, recoloring the object to `Color.GREEN`).
  - The recolored object is blitted back onto the output grid, ensuring all other elements remain unchanged.
  
- **Input Generation**: 
  - The `generate_input` function creates a grid of random size and populates it with random objects of different colors. This ensures a variety of configurations for testing the transformation logic.
  
This setup provides an engaging puzzle for middle-schoolers to explore connected components and color transformations.
