You are a puzzle maker designing geometric, physical, and topological puzzles for curious middle-schoolers.

Each puzzle consists of uncovering a deterministic rule, pattern, procedure, algorithm, or transformation law that maps inputs to outputs.
Both the inputs and outputs are 2D grids of colored pixels. There are 10 colors, but the order of the colors is never relevant to the puzzle.

The middle schoolers are trying to discover this deterministic transformation, which can be implemented as a Python function called `main`.
Designing a puzzle involves also creating example inputs, which can be implemented as a Python function called `generate_input`. Unlike `main`, the `generate_input` function should be stochastic, so that every time you run it, you get another good example of what the transformation can be applied to.

Here is a overview of the puzzle you are designing:

Concepts: 
hole counting, enclosed regions, guide object, connectivity (4/8)

Description: 
Input consists of a grid with a single guide object of a specific color, potentially enclosing regions of background color (e.g., 0). Count the number of enclosed regions (holes) within the guide object that are not of the guide object's color. Use specified connectivity (4 or 8) to determine whether regions are enclosed. Output is the integer count of such holes.

Please implement the puzzle by writing code containing the `generate_input` and `main` functions. Use the following standard library (`common.py`):

```python
def find_connected_components(grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=4, monochromatic=True):
    """
    Find the connected components in the grid. Returns a list of connected components, where each connected component is a numpy array.

    connectivity: 4 or 8, for 4-way or 8-way connectivity.
    monochromatic: if True, each connected component is assumed to have only one color. If False, each connected component can include multiple colors.
    """

def blit_object(grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK):
    """
    Draws an object onto the grid using its current location.

    Example usage:
    blit_object(output_grid, an_object, background=background_color)
    """

def blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y, background=Color.BLACK):
    """
    Draws a sprite onto the grid at the specified location.

    Example usage:
    blit_sprite(output_grid, the_sprite, x=x, y=y, background=background_color)
    """

def object_position(obj, background=Color.BLACK, anchor='upper left'):
    """
    (x,y) position of the provided object. By default, the upper left corner.

    anchor: "upper left", "upper right", "lower left", "lower right", "center", "upper center", "lower center", "left center", "right center"

    Example usage:
    x, y = object_position(obj, background=background_color, anchor="upper left")
    middle_x, middle_y = object_position(obj, background=background_color, anchor="center")
    """

def crop(grid, background=Color.BLACK):
    """
    Crop the grid to the smallest bounding box that contains all non-background pixels.

    Example usage:
    # Extract a sprite from an object
    sprite = crop(an_object, background=background_color)
    """

def random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=0, padding=0, padding_connectivity=8):
    """
    Find a random free location for the sprite in the grid
    Returns a tuple (x, y) of the top-left corner of the sprite in the grid, which can be passed to `blit_sprite`

    border_size: minimum distance from the edge of the grid
    background: color treated as transparent
    padding: if non-zero, the sprite will be padded with a non-background color before checking for collision
    padding_connectivity: 4 or 8, for 4-way or 8-way connectivity when padding the sprite

    Example usage:
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1, padding_connectivity=8, border_size=1, background=Color.BLACK) # find the location, using generous padding
    assert not collision(object1=grid, object2=sprite, x2=x, y2=y)
    blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)

    If no free location can be found, raises a ValueError.
    """

def object_interior(grid, background=Color.BLACK):
    """
    Computes the interior of the object (including edges)

    returns a new grid of `bool` where True indicates that the pixel is part of the object's interior.

    Example usage:

    for x, y in np.argwhere(interior):
        # x,y is either inside the object or at least on its edge
    """

def object_boundary(grid, background=Color.BLACK):

Your task is to implement the puzzle, following these steps:

1. Inspect the example puzzle implementations, making note of the functions used and the physical/geometric/topological/logical details
2. Inspect the new puzzle's description
3. Brainstorm a possible implementation for the new puzzle
4. Generate a code block formatted like the earlier examples with a comment starting `# concepts:` listing the concepts and `# description:` describing the inputs and transformation from the given description.

Be sure to make the transformation `main` deterministic. Follow the description closely.
