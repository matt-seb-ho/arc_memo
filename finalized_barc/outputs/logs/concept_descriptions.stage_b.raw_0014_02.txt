Here's a new puzzle implementation based on the provided description:

```python

# concepts:
# unique color selection, connected components, object identification, guide object

# description:
# In the input grid, you will see various colored objects. Each object is a connected component of the grid with a single color.
# Identify the color that is unique among all objects (meaning no other object has this color).
# The output grid should highlight or isolate the object with this unique color, turning all its pixels white, while all other objects remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all the connected components in the grid
    connected_components = find_connected_components(input_grid, monochromatic=True)
    
    # Dictionary to count occurrences of each color
    color_count = {}

    # Map each component to its color and count the occurrences
    for component in connected_components:
        color = np.unique(component)[1]  # skip background color (assumed to be first)
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1

    # Find the unique color (count == 1)
    unique_color = None
    for color, count in color_count.items():
        if count == 1:
            unique_color = color
            break

    if unique_color is None:
        raise ValueError("No unique color found in the grid.")

    # Create the output grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    
    # Isolate the object with the unique color by turning it white
    for component in connected_components:
        if np.any(component == unique_color):
            output_grid[component == unique_color] = Color.WHITE
    
    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    n = np.random.randint(10, 16)
    m = np.random.randint(10, 16)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)
    
    # List of colors to use, excluding black
    available_colors = list(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    
    # Number of objects to generate
    num_objects = np.random.randint(5, 8)

    # Ensure there's at least one unique color
    unique_color = np.random.choice(available_colors)
    colors_to_use = [unique_color] + np.random.choice(available_colors, num_objects - 1).tolist()

    np.random.shuffle(colors_to_use)  # Shuffle to ensure unique color is placed randomly
    
    for color in colors_to_use:
        # Generate random object (connected component) using the specified color
        sprite = random_sprite(np.random.randint(2, 5), np.random.randint(2, 5), color_palette=[color])
        
        # Try to place the sprite in the grid
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1, border_size=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            # If no valid position is found, retry
            continue

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **Concepts Used**:
   - **Unique Color Selection**: Identify the color that only one object has.
   - **Connected Components**: Detect objects on the grid as connected components.
   - **Guide Object**: The object with the unique color acts as a guide for the transformation.

2. **Description**:
   - The input grid contains multiple colored objects.
   - Each object is a connected component with a single color.
   - The task is to find the object whose color is not shared by any other object (i.e., unique).
   - The output grid highlights or isolates the unique object by turning it white, while leaving others unchanged.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - `find_connected_components` is used to identify and separate objects.
   - A dictionary tallies occurrences of each color.
   - The unique color is identified by checking the dictionary for a count of one.
   - The grid is updated to highlight the unique color object by turning it to white.
