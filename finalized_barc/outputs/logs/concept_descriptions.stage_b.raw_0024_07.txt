Here's a new puzzle implementation based on the given puzzle description and concepts:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# recolor, connected components, color scheme

# description:
# Identify a single connected object in the input grid. Apply a given color scheme to recolor the entire object. The color scheme may be a single color applied uniformly or a logic that determines the color for each part of the object. All other grid elements remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Detect all the connected components in the grid
    components = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=8, monochromatic=False)

    # For simplicity, apply the color scheme to the first detected object
    target_object = components[0]

    # Define a color scheme: cycle through a subset of colors
    color_scheme = [Color.RED, Color.BLUE, Color.GREEN, Color.YELLOW]

    # Apply the color scheme to the target object
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    for idx, (x, y) in enumerate(zip(*np.where(target_object != Color.BLACK))):
        output_grid[x, y] = color_scheme[idx % len(color_scheme)]

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a random grid size between 10x10 and 15x15
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 16), np.random.randint(10, 16)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a random connected object
    sprite_size = np.random.randint(4, min(n, m) // 2)
    sprite = random_sprite(sprite_size, sprite_size, color_palette=Color.NOT_BLACK, connectivity=8)

    # Place the sprite in the grid at a random location
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite)
    blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)

    return grid
```

### Explanation

1. **Concepts**: The puzzle involves identifying a single connected object in a grid and recoloring it using a predefined color scheme. It covers concepts like connected components and recoloring.

2. **Description**: The `main` function identifies one connected component and applies a cyclic color scheme to it. The `generate_input` function creates a grid with a randomly placed connected object. 

3. **Implementation**: 
   - `main`: It uses `find_connected_components` to detect objects, selects one, and applies a cyclic color scheme.
   - `generate_input`: It defines the grid size and generates a random connected sprite (object), then places it randomly in the grid.

This puzzle is designed to challenge students to understand connected components and color transformations in a grid setting.
