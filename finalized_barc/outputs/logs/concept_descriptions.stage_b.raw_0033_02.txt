Here's the implementation of the puzzle based on the given description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# orientation detection, recolor, connected components, bounding box

# description:
# Input is a single connected object on a grid. Determine the object's orientation by identifying the missing corner in its bounding box (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
# Recolor the entire object uniformly based on this orientation using a fixed color map: top-left to red (3), top-right to yellow (4), bottom-left to green (2), and bottom-right to blue (1).
# The background and any other grid content remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Extract the single connected object from the input grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, monochromatic=True, connectivity=8)
    assert len(objects) == 1, "There should be exactly one connected object in the input grid."
    object_grid = objects[0]

    # Determine the bounding box of the object
    x, y, width, height = bounding_box(object_grid, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Determine missing corner of the bounding box to find the orientation
    top_left = (x, y)
    top_right = (x, y + width - 1)
    bottom_left = (x + height - 1, y)
    bottom_right = (x + height - 1, y + width - 1)

    # Determine which corner is missing
    corners = [top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right]
    present_corners = [corner for corner in corners if object_grid[corner] != Color.BLACK]
    
    # Map present corners to the missing corner
    missing_corner_map = {
        frozenset([top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right]): "top-left",
        frozenset([top_left, bottom_left, bottom_right]): "top-right",
        frozenset([top_left, top_right, bottom_right]): "bottom-left",
        frozenset([top_left, top_right, bottom_left]): "bottom-right",
    }
    
    missing_corner = missing_corner_map[frozenset(present_corners)]

    # Color map based on missing corner
    color_map = {
        "top-left": Color.RED,
        "top-right": Color.YELLOW,
        "bottom-left": Color.GREEN,
        "bottom-right": Color.BLUE
    }
    
    # Recolor the object uniformly based on the missing corner
    recolor = color_map[missing_corner]
    flood_fill(object_grid, x, y, recolor)

    # Copy the recolored object back to the original grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    blit_object(output_grid, object_grid, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid with a single connected object with a missing corner
    grid_size = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    input_grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), Color.BLACK)

    # Create a random sprite with a missing corner
    sprite_size = np.random.randint(4, 8)
    sprite = np.full((sprite_size, sprite_size), Color.TEAL)
    
    # Remove a random corner
    corners = [(0, 0), (0, sprite_size - 1), (sprite_size - 1, 0), (sprite_size - 1, sprite_size - 1)]
    missing_corner = random.choice(corners)
    sprite[missing_corner] = Color.BLACK

    # Place sprite at a random location in the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(input_grid, sprite, border_size=1, padding=0)
    blit_sprite(input_grid, sprite, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)

    return input_grid
```

This implementation uses the provided `common.py` functions to handle the grid-based operations, ensuring that the transformation is deterministic and follows the puzzle's description. The `generate_input` function creates new examples by randomly generating connected objects with a missing corner.
