Below is a new puzzle implementation based on the provided description of identifying a guide object and using its color to fill a designated tiling area or pattern across the grid. The puzzle is implemented using the functions from the `common.py` library.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, color transfer, tiling

# description:
# In the input grid, identify a guide object with a unique color. Use the color of this guide object to fill a designated tiling pattern (checkerboard) across the grid. The checkerboard pattern is predefined and does not alter the structure of the grid, only the color. All other grid elements remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Detect the guide object by its unique color
    unique_color_objects = detect_objects(grid=input_grid, monochromatic=True, connectivity=8)
    guide_object = max(unique_color_objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))
    guide_color = guide_object[guide_object != Color.BLACK][0]

    # Create a checkerboard pattern for the output grid
    n, m = input_grid.shape
    checkerboard_pattern = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)

    # Fill the checkerboard pattern with the guide color
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if (i + j) % 2 == 0:
                checkerboard_pattern[i, j] = guide_color
    
    # Overlay the checkerboard pattern onto the input grid
    output_grid = np.where(checkerboard_pattern != 0, checkerboard_pattern, input_grid)
    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid with random colors
    n, m = np.random.randint(5, 10, size=2)
    grid = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), size=(n, m))

    # Place a guide object with a unique color
    unique_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    while unique_color in grid:
        unique_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    # Define the guide object as a small square (2x2) with the unique color
    x, y = np.random.randint(0, n-2), np.random.randint(0, m-2)
    grid[x:x+2, y:y+2] = unique_color

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

- **Concepts**: The puzzle involves using a guide object to influence a color transformation across a grid, specifically through a tiling pattern.
  
- **Description**:
  - **Input**: The input grid contains various colored pixels, including a guide object with a unique color.
  - **Output**: The guide object's color is used to fill a checkerboard pattern across the grid. This pattern is predefined and affects only the color, not the grid's structure. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

### Steps:

1. **Guide Object Detection**:
   - The `detect_objects` function identifies objects in the grid. The guide object is determined by its unique color, which is the most frequent color in this object.

2. **Checkerboard Pattern Creation**:
   - A checkerboard pattern is generated, where alternating cells are filled with the guide object's color.

3. **Overlay Pattern**:
   - The checkerboard pattern is overlaid onto the input grid, replacing only specific cells while preserving other grid elements.

4. **Input Generation**:
   - The `generate_input` function creates a random grid and places a guide object with a unique color, ensuring the puzzle remains stochastic while maintaining the necessary conditions for the puzzle to work.
