Here is an implementation of the puzzle using the provided framework and description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# divider lines, region extraction, array slicing

# description:
# Input is a grid potentially divided into distinct regions by horizontal or vertical lines of a specific color.
# Identify these divider lines and use them to segment the grid into separate regions. Each region is extracted as a subgrid, excluding the divider lines themselves.
# Output is a list of these subgrids, preserving their original content and relative order.

def main(input_grid):
    # Plan:
    # 1. Identify the divider color by finding a line that extends completely in either direction.
    # 2. Use the divider lines to segment the grid into regions, excluding the lines themselves.
    # 3. Extract each region as a subgrid and return a list of these subgrids.

    # Find divider color
    divider_color = None

        if np.all(input_grid[x, :] == input_grid[x, 0]):

            if region.size > 0:  # Exclude empty regions
                regions.append(region)

    return regions

### Explanation:

- **Divider Identification**: We determine the divider color by identifying any row or column that is completely filled with the same color, assuming that color is a divider.

- **Region Segmentation**: Using the positions of the divider lines, the grid is sliced into subgrids, ensuring that the dividers themselves are excluded from these subgrids.

- **Subgrid Extraction**: The extracted subgrids are appended to a list that is returned, representing distinct regions of the original grid.

- **Input Generation**: A stochastic input generator creates grids with random dimensions, fills them with random colors, and adds divider lines of a random color at specified intervals. The dividers ensure that regions are appropriately separated for extraction.
