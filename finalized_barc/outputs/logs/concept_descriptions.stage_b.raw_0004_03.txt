Let's implement the described puzzle where we identify a unique guide object based on a distinct attribute, use its anchor point, and count the number of enclosed regions (holes) from that anchor point. We'll assume the distinct attribute is color, and we will consider the centroid as the anchor point. The grid will contain various colored objects, and we will count the number of holes for the identified guide object.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, unique selection, anchor point, hole counting

# description:
# The input grid contains multiple colored objects on a black background. One of these objects is uniquely colored (guide object).
# Use this guide object's centroid as an anchor point. From this anchor, count the number of fully enclosed black regions (holes) within the grid.
# The output is a grid with the count of holes displayed at the location of the guide object's centroid.

This implementation generates a grid with various colored objects, one of which is uniquely colored. The `main` function identifies this guide object, calculates the number of enclosed regions (holes) from its centroid, and marks this count on the grid.
