Below is a new puzzle implementation inspired by the given puzzle descriptions. This puzzle focuses on the concept of detecting and continuing a pattern of color gradient transformation over time.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# color gradient transformation, sequence prediction, pattern extrapolation

# description:
# In the input, you will see a sequence of grids, each representing a time step.
# Objects in these grids exhibit a pattern of color gradient transformation.
# Your task is to identify this color gradient transformation pattern and extrapolate it to predict the next grid in the sequence.

def main(input_grids):
    last_grid = input_grids[-1]
    next_grid = last_grid.copy()

    # Analyze color changes over time steps
    time_steps = len(input_grids)
    color_changes = {}

    for t in range(1, time_steps):
        prev_grid = input_grids[t-1]
        curr_grid = input_grids[t]
        
        for obj in find_connected_components(prev_grid, monochromatic=True):
            x, y = object_position(obj)
            color_before = prev_grid[x, y]
            color_after = curr_grid[x, y]

            if color_before != color_after:
                if color_before not in color_changes:
                    color_changes[color_before] = []
                color_changes[color_before].append(color_after)

    # Determine the most common transformation for each color
    color_transformation = {}
    for color, transformations in color_changes.items():
        most_common_transformation = max(set(transformations), key=transformations.count)
        color_transformation[color] = most_common_transformation

    # Apply the detected transformations to predict the next grid
    for x in range(next_grid.shape[0]):
        for y in range(next_grid.shape[1]):
            current_color = last_grid[x, y]
            if current_color in color_transformation:
                next_grid[x, y] = color_transformation[current_color]

    return next_grid


def generate_input():
    # Randomly determine grid dimensions
    n, m = np.random.randint(5, 10), np.random.randint(5, 10)

    # Create a sequence of grids
    sequence_length = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    grids = [np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK) for _ in range(sequence_length)]

    # Randomly place initial colored pixels
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    colors = list(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    np.random.shuffle(colors)
    initial_colors = colors[:num_objects]

    for color in initial_colors:
        x, y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
        grids[0][x, y] = color

    # Define a random color transformation pattern
    color_transformation = {}
    remaining_colors = list(Color.NOT_BLACK - set(initial_colors))
    for color in initial_colors:
        next_color = np.random.choice(remaining_colors)
        color_transformation[color] = next_color

    # Apply the transformation over time steps
    for t in range(1, sequence_length):
        prev_grid = grids[t-1]
        curr_grid = grids[t]

        for x in range(n):
            for y in range(m):
                current_color = prev_grid[x, y]
                if current_color in color_transformation:
                    curr_grid[x, y] = color_transformation[current_color]

    return grids

### Explanation:

- **Concepts**: This puzzle involves detecting a pattern of color gradient transformation over time and predicting the next step in the sequence.
- **Description**: The input sequence consists of grids with objects that change color following a specific deterministic pattern. The task is to analyze the sequence to identify this pattern and extrapolate it to produce the next grid in the sequence.
- **Implementation Details**: 
  - The `main` function analyzes the input sequence of grids to determine how colors change over the sequence. It then applies the most common transformations to produce the next grid.
  - The `generate_input` function creates a sequence of grids, initializes objects with random colors, defines a random color transformation pattern, and applies it across the sequence to simulate the pattern.
