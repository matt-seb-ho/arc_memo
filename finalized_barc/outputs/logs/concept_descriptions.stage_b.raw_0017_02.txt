Certainly! Let's design a new puzzle based on the provided description. The puzzle will involve identifying enclosed "holes" within a single object and highlighting them.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# holes, enclosed regions, flood-fill, background components

# description:
# The input consists of a grid with a single object using one color and a black background (0).
# The task is to identify holes, which are fully enclosed black regions within the object that are not connected to the grid border.
# The output grid should highlight these enclosed holes with a different color, such as red, while leaving non-enclosed regions the same.

def main(input_grid):
    # Create a copy of the input grid for output.
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # Flood fill from the grid border to identify non-enclosed regions.
    border_filled = flood_fill_from_border(input_grid)

    # Calculate enclosed regions by finding black areas not connected to the border-filled areas.
    enclosed_mask = (input_grid == Color.BLACK) & ~border_filled

    # Color enclosed holes with red.
    output_grid[enclosed_mask] = Color.RED

    return output_grid

def flood_fill_from_border(grid):
    # Create a mask to track filled areas starting from the border.
    filled = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)

    # Add border pixels to the queue to start flood fill.
    queue = []
    n, m = grid.shape
    for i in range(n):
        if grid[i, 0] == Color.BLACK:
            queue.append((i, 0))
        if grid[i, m - 1] == Color.BLACK:
            queue.append((i, m - 1))
    
    for j in range(m):
        if grid[0, j] == Color.BLACK:
            queue.append((0, j))
        if grid[n - 1, j] == Color.BLACK:
            queue.append((n - 1, j))

    # Perform flood fill to find all black regions connected to the border.
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.pop(0)
        if filled[x, y] or grid[x, y] != Color.BLACK:
            continue
        filled[x, y] = True
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not filled[nx, ny]:
                queue.append((nx, ny))

    return filled

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with a size between 10x10 and 20x20.
    size = np.random.randint(10, 21)
    grid = np.full((size, size), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a single object with a random size.
    object_size = np.random.randint(5, size - 2)
    object_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    object_sprite = random_sprite(object_size, object_size, color_palette=[object_color], background=Color.BLACK)

    # Place the object randomly on the grid.
    try:
        x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, object_sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1)
    except ValueError:
        return generate_input()

    blit_sprite(grid, object_sprite, x, y)

    # Introduce holes within the object.
    num_holes = np.random.randint(1, 4)
    for _ in range(num_holes):
        hole_size = np.random.randint(1, object_size // 2)
        hole_x, hole_y = np.random.randint(1, object_size - hole_size, size=2)
        grid[x + hole_x:x + hole_x + hole_size, y + hole_y:y + hole_y + hole_size] = Color.BLACK

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

- **Concepts**: The puzzle leverages concepts of identifying enclosed regions and flood-filling to differentiate between holes and non-holes.
  
- **Main Function** (`main`):
  - We create a copy of the input grid to modify.
  - The `flood_fill_from_border` function identifies all black regions connected to the grid's border.
  - Enclosed holes are identified by checking black regions not connected to the border.
  - These enclosed holes are then colored red in the output grid.

- **Flood Fill Function** (`flood_fill_from_border`):
  - This function starts from the grid's border and floods all connected black regions to mark them as filled.

- **Input Generator** (`generate_input`):
  - It creates a grid with a random size and places a single random-colored object on it.
  - Random holes are introduced within this object, ensuring they are fully enclosed for the puzzle to work correctly.
