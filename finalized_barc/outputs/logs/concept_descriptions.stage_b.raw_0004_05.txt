To implement the puzzle based on the description provided, we will:

1. Identify a unique guide object based on a distinct attribute (e.g., color or size).
2. Use the guide's anchor point, such as its centroid or top-left corner, as the starting point.
3. From this anchor, count the number of enclosed regions (holes) in the grid.
4. The output will be a count of these holes, originating from the guide's position.

The transformation should be deterministic, while the input generation will be stochastic.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, unique selection, anchor point, hole counting

# description:
# In the input, you will see various colored objects on a black background. 
# One of these objects is a "guide object", identifiable by its distinct color or size.
# Use the guide's anchor point (e.g., center) as the starting point.
# From this anchor, count how many enclosed regions (holes) exist in the grid.
# The output will be a grid with a single number representing this count.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=4)

    # Identify the guide object based on a distinct attribute (we'll use color here for uniqueness)
    colors = [np.unique(obj[obj != Color.BLACK]) for obj in objects]
    unique_colors = [color for color in Color.ALL_COLORS if colors.count(color) == 1]
    
    # Assume the guide object is the one with a unique color
    guide_object = None
    for obj in objects:
        obj_color = np.unique(obj[obj != Color.BLACK])
        if obj_color in unique_colors:
            guide_object = obj
            break

    if guide_object is None:
        raise ValueError("No guide object found")

    # Use the guide's anchor point (center) as the starting position
    anchor_x, anchor_y = object_position(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK, anchor='center')

    # Count the number of enclosed regions (holes) in the grid starting from the anchor point
    # We will consider holes as black regions fully enclosed by colored regions
    interior = object_interior(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK)
    hole_count = 0

    # Check for holes
    for y in range(interior.shape[0]):
        for x in range(interior.shape[1]):
            if interior[y, x] and input_grid[y, x] == Color.BLACK:
                # If the pixel is part of an enclosed black region, count it as a hole
                hole_count += 1

    # Create an output grid to display the hole count
    output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, Color.BLACK)
    output_grid[anchor_y, anchor_x] = hole_count

    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Create a random grid with objects of various colors
    n, m = np.random.randint(12, 20, size=2)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Create some objects, one of which has a unique color
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    used_colors = set()

    for _ in range(num_objects):
        # Generate a random color not used before
        color = np.random.choice([c for c in Color.NOT_BLACK if c not in used_colors])
        used_colors.add(color)

        # Create a random object with the chosen color
        obj_height, obj_width = np.random.randint(3, 5, size=2)
        obj = random_sprite(obj_height, obj_width, color_palette=[color], background=Color.BLACK)
        
        # Place the object in the grid
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, obj, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, obj, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
        except ValueError:
            continue

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
- **`main` Function:** Identifies a "guide object" based on a unique color, uses its center as the anchor point, and counts the number of fully enclosed black regions (holes) in the grid starting from the anchor point.
- **`generate_input` Function:** Creates a stochastic grid setup with several colored objects, ensuring one of them has a unique color to serve as the guide object. This function ensures variability in the input while maintaining the puzzle's deterministic nature.
