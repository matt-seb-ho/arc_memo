Here's the implementation for the puzzle you described, where we translate and align the target object to the reference object:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# translation, alignment, merging, connected components

# description:
# In the input, a grid contains two distinct objects: a reference object and a target object.
# A direction is specified (up, down, left, or right) indicating where the target should be translated.
# The goal is to translate the target object until it touches the reference object on the specified side.
# After aligning, merge the target object into the reference object by painting target pixels into the grid,
# preserving existing reference pixels. The output grid shows the target object aligned and merged with the reference object.

def main(input_grid, direction):
    # Find the connected components in the grid, assuming black is the background
    components = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=4, monochromatic=False)

    # Assume the first object is the reference and the second is the target
    reference = components[0]
    target = components[1]

    # Create a copy of the input grid to prepare the output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Determine the translation vector based on the specified direction
    translation_vector = {
        "up": (0, -1),
        "down": (0, 1),
        "left": (-1, 0),
        "right": (1, 0),
    }[direction]

    # Translate the target until it touches the reference on the specified side
    while not contact(object1=reference, object2=target):
        target = translate(target, *translation_vector, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Merge the target object into the reference object, preserving existing reference pixels
    blit_object(output_grid, target, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Create a 10x10 black grid
    grid = np.full((10, 10), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a random reference object
    ref_obj = random_sprite(n=3, m=3, color_palette=[random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)], connectivity=4)

    # Generate a random target object
    target_obj = random_sprite(n=3, m=3, color_palette=[random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)], connectivity=4)

    # Place the reference object randomly in the grid
    x_ref, y_ref = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, ref_obj, background=Color.BLACK)
    blit_sprite(grid, ref_obj, x=x_ref, y=y_ref, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Place the target object randomly in the grid
    x_target, y_target = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, target_obj, background=Color.BLACK)
    blit_sprite(grid, target_obj, x=x_target, y=y_target, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Randomly choose a direction for the target to move towards the reference
    direction = random.choice(["up", "down", "left", "right"])

    return grid, direction
```

### Explanation:
- **`main` Function**: 
  - Detects the connected components in the input grid to identify the reference and target objects.
  - Determines the translation vector based on the specified direction.
  - Translates the target object until it touches the reference object on the specified side.
  - Merges the target object into the reference object by painting the target onto the grid, preserving existing reference pixels.

- **`generate_input` Function**:
  - Creates a 10x10 grid and places a reference object and a target object randomly.
  - Randomly selects a direction (up, down, left, right) for the target to move towards the reference object.
