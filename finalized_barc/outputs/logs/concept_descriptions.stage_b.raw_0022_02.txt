# pattern extrapolation, sequence prediction, feature analysis, progression detection

# description:
# The input consists of a sequence of grids representing consecutive time steps, where objects exhibit a consistent transformation pattern in terms of position (moving rightward).
# Analyze the sequence to identify the evolving pattern of linear movement. Extrapolate the identified pattern to predict and generate the next grid in the sequence.
# The output is a single grid that continues the detected pattern logically from the last input grid.

### Explanation

- **Concepts:** This puzzle involves pattern extrapolation, sequence prediction, feature analysis, and progression detection. The objects in the grid move in a consistent pattern (rightward in this case) and the task is to predict the next state.
  
- **Description:** The `main` function takes a sequence of grids and predicts the next grid in the sequence based on the detected movement pattern (rightward movement of objects). The `generate_input` function creates a sequence of grids with objects moving right over a series of time steps.

The goal is for students to understand the movement pattern and predict the next grid by extrapolating the pattern.
