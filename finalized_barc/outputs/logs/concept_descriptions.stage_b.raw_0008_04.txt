Here's the implementation for the described puzzle: 

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# recolor, connected components, color scheme

# description:
# Identify a single connected component (object) within the grid. Apply a given color scheme to recolor the entire object. 
# The color scheme may be a single color or a function that determines the color based on object properties.
# All other grid elements remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Detect all the objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, monochromatic=False, connectivity=8)
    
    # Choose a random object to recolor
    target_object = np.random.choice(objects)

    # Determine the color scheme based on object properties
    # Here, we simply choose a random color from the available colors except black
    new_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    # Apply the color scheme to the entire object
    target_object[target_object != Color.BLACK] = new_color

    # Create the output grid by placing the modified object onto the original grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    blit_object(output_grid, target_object, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of size 10x10 to 20x20
    n = np.random.randint(10, 21)
    grid = np.full((n, n), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate and place random objects in the grid until it is somewhat full
    for _ in range(np.random.randint(3, 6)):
        # Generate a random colored object
        obj = random_sprite(list(range(3, 6)), list(range(3, 6)), color_palette=list(Color.NOT_BLACK), connectivity=8)
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, obj, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, obj, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
        except ValueError:
            break

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
1. **Concepts**: The puzzle involves recoloring a single connected component within a grid. This requires identifying connected components, determining a color scheme, and applying it.
   
2. **Description**: The puzzle takes a grid as input, identifies a connected component, and recolors it using a predetermined scheme. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

3. **`main` Function**: 
   - Detects all connected objects in the grid.
   - Chooses one object randomly and determines a new color scheme.
   - Recolors the chosen object and places it back into the grid to form the output.

4. **`generate_input` Function**:
   - Creates a grid with random size between 10x10 and 20x20.
   - Randomly generates colored objects and places them on the grid.
   - Ensures a variety of objects are present for the transformation.

This implementation is designed to be both educational and engaging for middle-schoolers, encouraging them to think about color patterns and object properties within a grid.
