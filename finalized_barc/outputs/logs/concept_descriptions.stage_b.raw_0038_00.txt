Below is a new puzzle implementation that involves extracting connected components from a color grid, applying a selection criterion, and outputting the selected components.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# object selection, connected components, filtering

# description:
# The input is a grid containing several colored objects. Each object is a connected component of pixels with the same color.
# To produce the output, extract all connected components and filter them such that only those with an area greater than a threshold remain.
# The output is a list of selected objects, represented by their bounding boxes and constituent pixels. Non-selected objects are excluded.

def main(input_grid):
    # Define the area threshold for selection
    area_threshold = 5

    # Detect all connected components in the input grid
    components = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=4, monochromatic=True)

    # Prepare a list to store the selected objects
    selected_objects = []

    # Iterate over each component to apply the selection criterion
    for comp in components:
        # Calculate the area of the component (number of pixels)
        area = np.sum(comp != Color.BLACK)

        # If the component's area is greater than the threshold, select it
        if area > area_threshold:
            # Crop the component to get its bounding box
            cropped_comp = crop(comp, background=Color.BLACK)

            # Add the cropped component to the list of selected objects
            selected_objects.append(cropped_comp)

    return selected_objects

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid with dimensions between 10x10 to 20x20
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 20, size=2)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Define the number of objects to place on the grid
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)

    # Place objects randomly on the grid
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        # Randomly determine the size of the object
        obj_n, obj_m = np.random.randint(2, 5, size=2)

        # Create a random sprite of the object
        obj_color = random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
        sprite = random_sprite(obj_n, obj_m, color_palette=[obj_color], density=0.5)

        # Try to place the object in the grid
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, border_size=1, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            # If no space, continue with next object
            continue

    return grid
```

This puzzle prompts students to understand how to extract and manipulate connected components in a grid and apply a filtering criterion based on a property of the components, such as their area. The `generate_input` function creates a grid with several random colored objects, while the `main` function extracts and filters these objects based on the specified area threshold.
