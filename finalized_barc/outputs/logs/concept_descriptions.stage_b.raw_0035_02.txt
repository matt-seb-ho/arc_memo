Here's the implementation of the puzzle based on the described concepts and transformation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# diagonal movement, zigzag pattern, axis-aligned runs, boundary detection

# description:
# From a seed pixel, create a diagonal zigzag pattern by alternating between horizontal and vertical movements.
# Move horizontally by a fixed number of pixels (horizontal_step), then vertically by another fixed number (vertical_step), painting each traversed pixel.
# Continue this alternating pattern until reaching the grid boundary, forming a staircase-like diagonal.

def main(input_grid):
    # Output grid is the same size as the input grid
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Find the seed pixel
    seed_pixel = find_connected_components(input_grid, monochromatic=True)[0]
    seed_color = object_colors(seed_pixel)[0]
    seed_x, seed_y = object_position(seed_pixel)

    # Define step sizes
    horizontal_step = 3
    vertical_step = 2

    # Start creating the zigzag pattern
    x, y = seed_x, seed_y
    width, height = output_grid.shape

    while x < width and y < height:
        # Draw horizontal line
        end_x = min(x + horizontal_step, width)
        draw_line(output_grid, x, y, end_x=end_x, direction=(1, 0), color=seed_color)
        x = end_x

        # Draw vertical line
        end_y = min(y + vertical_step, height)
        draw_line(output_grid, x - 1, y, end_y=end_y, direction=(0, 1), color=seed_color)
        y = end_y

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a random grid size
    width, height = np.random.randint(10, 20, size=2)
    grid = np.zeros((width, height), dtype=int)

    # Randomly choose a color for the seed pixel
    seed_color = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)

    # Randomly place the seed pixel within the grid
    x = np.random.randint(0, width)
    y = np.random.randint(0, height)
    grid[x, y] = seed_color

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **Concepts**: The puzzle involves creating a zigzag pattern with alternating horizontal and vertical lines starting from a seed pixel.
   
2. **Description**: 
   - The input grid contains a single seed pixel of a random color.
   - The transformation involves creating a zigzag pattern starting from this seed pixel, by moving horizontally by a fixed step and then vertically by another fixed step, alternating these movements until a grid boundary is reached.
   - The output grid shows this staircase-like pattern formed by the zigzag movement.

3. **Implementation**:
   - `generate_input` randomly creates a grid with one colored seed pixel.
   - `main` performs the deterministic transformation, drawing a zigzag pattern from the seed pixel using predefined horizontal and vertical steps until it reaches the grid boundary.
   - The `draw_line` function from `common.py` is used to create the horizontal and vertical segments of the zigzag pattern.
