Here's a new puzzle implementation based on the provided description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, color transfer, tiling

# description:
# In the input grid, identify a guide object with a unique color. Use the color of this guide object to fill a predefined tiling pattern across the grid.
# The tiling pattern is a checkerboard pattern and does not alter the structure of the grid, only the coloring. All other grid elements remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find the guide object with a unique color
    guide_object = detect_objects(grid=input_grid, monochromatic=True, connectivity=8)[0]
    guide_color = guide_object[guide_object != Color.BLACK][0]

    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Generate a checkerboard pattern using the guide object's color
    for x in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for y in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if (x + y) % 2 == 0:
                output_grid[x, y] = guide_color

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a random grid size
    width, height = np.random.randint(5, 10, size=2)
    grid = np.full((width, height), Color.BLACK)

    # Choose a unique color for the guide object
    guide_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    # Place a guide object with the unique color in a random location on the grid
    guide_object = np.array([[guide_color]])
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, x=x, y=y)

    return grid
```

### Explanation

- **`main` function**:
  - Detects the guide object in the input grid using the `detect_objects` function, identifying it by its unique color.
  - Extracts the color of the guide object to be used for the checkerboard pattern.
  - Creates the output grid by copying the input grid and applying the checkerboard pattern using the guide color. The pattern is applied such that alternating cells are colored with the guide color while maintaining the original structure of the grid.

- **`generate_input` function**:
  - Generates a grid of random size filled with `Color.BLACK`.
  - Randomly selects a unique color from `Color.NOT_BLACK` for the guide object.
  - Places the guide object with the unique color at a random location on the grid, ensuring it's not overlapping with other objects. This ensures that each generated input is varied and tests the ability to identify the guide correctly.

This puzzle challenges the user to identify a guide object based on its unique color and apply a checkerboard pattern using that color across the grid.
