Here is a new puzzle implementation based on the described concept of a guide object acting as a starting point for a position-based transformation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, position-based transformation, pattern expansion

# description:
# In the input grid, you will find a distinct guide object with a unique color, which serves as the starting point.
# From this guide position, expand a specific pattern outward, filling in a predetermined shape or pattern until a border or another object is encountered.

def main(input_grid):
    # Detect all the objects in the grid to find the guide object
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)

    # Identify the guide object by its unique color
    guide_color = None
    for obj in objects:
        colors = object_colors(obj)
        if len(colors) == 1 and colors[0] != Color.BLACK:
            guide_color = colors[0]
            guide_object = obj
            break

    assert guide_color is not None, "Guide object with a unique color not found"

    # Get the starting position of the guide object
    guide_x, guide_y, _, _ = bounding_box(guide_object)

    # Create a copy of the input grid to start the transformation
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Define the pattern to be expanded, e.g., a cross pattern
    pattern = [
        (0, 0),  # center
        (-1, 0), (1, 0),  # vertical line
        (0, -1), (0, 1)  # horizontal line
    ]

    # Expand the pattern from the guide position
    for dx, dy in pattern:
        x, y = guide_x + dx, guide_y + dy
        if 0 <= x < output_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= y < output_grid.shape[1]:
            if output_grid[x, y] == Color.BLACK:  # fill only empty spaces
                output_grid[x, y] = guide_color

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid with random size
    n, m = np.random.randint(5, 10), np.random.randint(5, 10)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Randomly select a unique color for the guide object
    guide_color = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)

    # Place the guide object at a random location
    guide_sprite = np.array([[guide_color]])
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, background=Color.BLACK)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, x, y)

    # Optionally add some obstacles to make the transformation more interesting
    obstacle_count = np.random.randint(1, 4)
    for _ in range(obstacle_count):
        obstacle_color = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)
        if obstacle_color != guide_color:
            obstacle_sprite = random_sprite(1, 1, color_palette=[obstacle_color])
            try:
                x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, obstacle_sprite, background=Color.BLACK, padding=1)
                blit_sprite(grid, obstacle_sprite, x, y)
            except ValueError:
                continue

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
- **Concepts**: This puzzle uses the concept of a guide object to initiate a transformation. The guide object's unique color is used to identify it. From this position, a pattern (in this case, a cross) is expanded outward until it hits a border or another object.
- **Description**: The input grid contains a single unique-colored guide object. The task is to expand a cross-shaped pattern starting from the guide's position. The expansion stops when it encounters non-black pixels or the grid's edge. The output grid should reflect this transformation.
- **Determinism**: The transformation in `main` is deterministic as it always starts from the identified guide object's position and expands a fixed pattern.
- **Stochastic Input Generation**: The `generate_input` function ensures that each input grid has a unique-colored guide object and some obstacles, with variations in grid size and object placement.
