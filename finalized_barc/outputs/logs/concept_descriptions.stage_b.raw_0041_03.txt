Certainly! Let's create a new puzzle based on the description you've provided. We'll design a puzzle where the middle schoolers have to identify a guide object and use it as a starting point for a specific transformation.

### Puzzle Description:

**Concepts:**
- Guide object identification
- Position-based transformation
- Pattern identification

**Description:**
In the input, you will find a grid filled with colored pixels and one distinct "guide" object with a unique color (e.g., TEAL). The task is to identify this guide object and apply a transformation starting from its position. The transformation involves changing all pixels in the same row and column as the guide object to a new color (e.g., RED), except for the guide object itself.

Here's how this puzzle can be implemented:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# Concepts:
# guide object, position-based transformation, row and column manipulation

# Description:
# In the input, you will see a grid with various colored pixels and a distinct guide object of a unique color (e.g., TEAL).
# The task is to locate the guide object and transform all other pixels in the same row and column to a new color (e.g., RED),
# leaving the guide object itself unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find the guide object, which is the only one with the color TEAL
    guide_objects = detect_objects(grid=input_grid, colors=[Color.TEAL], monochromatic=True, connectivity=4)
    assert len(guide_objects) == 1, "There should be exactly one guide object"
    
    guide_object = guide_objects[0]
    guide_x, guide_y, _, _ = bounding_box(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # Change all pixels in the same row and column as the guide object to RED
    output_grid[guide_x, :] = Color.RED
    output_grid[:, guide_y] = Color.RED

    # Restore the guide object to its original color
    output_grid[guide_x, guide_y] = Color.TEAL

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid of random size between 5x5 and 10x10
    n, m = np.random.randint(5, 11), np.random.randint(5, 11)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK, dtype=int)

    # Randomly fill the grid with colors
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            grid[i, j] = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))

    # Select a random position for the guide object
    guide_x, guide_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    grid[guide_x, guide_y] = Color.TEAL

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

- **Guide Object Identification:** The guide object is identified by its unique color, TEAL, using `detect_objects`.
- **Transformation:** Once the guide object's position is known, the transformation changes all pixels in the same row and column to RED, while keeping the guide object TEAL.
- **Generate Input:** The `generate_input` function creates a random grid with various colors and places a single TEAL pixel as the guide object.

This puzzle encourages students to understand object detection, grid manipulation, and the concept of row and column transformations, all derived from identifying and using a guide object.
