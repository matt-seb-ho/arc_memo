Here's the implementation of the new puzzle based on the provided description. The puzzle involves identifying runs of a specific color (cyan) within a grid and applying a transformation to these runs by capping them with another color (yellow).

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# color runs, recolor, bounding box, symmetry

# description:
# Identify contiguous horizontal or vertical runs of cyan (color=4) in the grid. For each run, compute k 
# as the minimum of 3 or half the run's length (rounded down). Recolor the first k and last k cells of each run 
# to yellow (color=3), leaving the interior cells unchanged. This transformation applies symmetrically to both ends 
# of each cyan run, capping them with yellow while preserving the run's central portion.

def main(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    cyan_color = 4
    yellow_color = 3

    # Process horizontal runs
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        j = 0
        while j < output_grid.shape[1]:
            if output_grid[i, j] == cyan_color:
                start = j
                while j < output_grid.shape[1] and output_grid[i, j] == cyan_color:
                    j += 1
                end = j
                length = end - start
                k = min(3, length // 2)
                # Color the first k and last k cells of the run yellow
                output_grid[i, start:start + k] = yellow_color
                output_grid[i, end - k:end] = yellow_color
            j += 1

    # Process vertical runs
    for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
        i = 0
        while i < output_grid.shape[0]:
            if output_grid[i, j] == cyan_color:
                start = i
                while i < output_grid.shape[0] and output_grid[i, j] == cyan_color:
                    i += 1
                end = i
                length = end - start
                k = min(3, length // 2)
                # Color the first k and last k cells of the run yellow
                output_grid[start:start + k, j] = yellow_color
                output_grid[end - k:end, j] = yellow_color
            i += 1

    return output_grid

def generate_input() -> np.ndarray:
    # Define grid dimensions
    n = np.random.randint(5, 15)
    m = np.random.randint(5, 15)
    
    # Initialize grid with black
    grid = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)

    # Determine number of cyan runs
    num_runs = np.random.randint(1, 5)

    for _ in range(num_runs):
        is_horizontal = np.random.choice([True, False])
        if is_horizontal:
            row = np.random.randint(0, n)
            start_col = np.random.randint(0, m - 1)
            run_length = np.random.randint(2, m - start_col + 1)
            grid[row, start_col:start_col + run_length] = 4  # Cyan
        else:
            col = np.random.randint(0, m)
            start_row = np.random.randint(0, n - 1)
            run_length = np.random.randint(2, n - start_row + 1)
            grid[start_row:start_row + run_length, col] = 4  # Cyan

    return grid
```

This puzzle involves recognizing and transforming contiguous runs of a designated color (cyan) within a grid. The transformation involves recoloring the ends of these runs symmetrically to yellow, creating visually interesting patterns and emphasizing the contemplation of symmetry and bounding in grids.
