To implement the puzzle as described, we'll create a Python script using the provided standard library to handle 2D grid manipulations. Here's how we can implement the puzzle:

1. **Concepts**: Identify a unique guide object, color transfer, line drawing.

2. **Description**: The task is to identify a guide object, which is uniquely colored on the grid, and use its color to draw a line between two specified points or along a specified path. This line is drawn by overwriting the background cells with the guide object's color, while preserving any non-background cells.

Here is the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, color transfer, line drawing

# description:
# Identify a guide object with a unique color in the grid.
# Use this color to draw a line between two specified points or along a specified path.
# The line is drawn by overwriting the background cells with the guide object's color.
# All other non-background cells remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Copy the input grid to create the output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Find all connected components in the grid
    components = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)
    
    # Identify the guide object by finding the unique colored component
    for component in components:
        color = np.unique(component[component != Color.BLACK])
        if len(color) == 1:
            guide_color = color[0]
            break

    # Define start and end points for the line
    # For demonstration, we'll assume the start point is the top-left corner and the end point is the bottom-right corner of the grid
    start_point = (0, 0)
    end_point = (input_grid.shape[0] - 1, input_grid.shape[1] - 1)

    # Use the guide color to draw the line
    draw_line(output_grid, x=start_point[0], y=start_point[1], end_x=end_point[0], end_y=end_point[1], color=guide_color)
    
    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of random size
    n = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    m = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Randomly select a guide color from the available colors
    guide_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    # Create a unique guide object
    guide_obj = np.full((2, 2), guide_color)
    
    # Place the guide object in the grid at a random free location
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_obj, border_size=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_obj, x, y)

    # Add random colored objects in the grid to increase complexity
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        obj_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK - {guide_color}))
        obj_size = np.random.randint(2, 4)
        obj = random_sprite(obj_size, obj_size, density=0.5, color_palette=[obj_color])
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, obj, border_size=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, obj, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            continue  # Skip adding this object if no space is available

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
- **`main` Function**: 
  - Finds the unique colored guide object in the grid.
  - Draws a line from the top-left to the bottom-right corner using the guide object's color.
  
- **`generate_input` Function**: 
  - Creates a grid with a random size and fills it with black.
  - Places a guide object of a unique color randomly in the grid.
  - Adds additional random colored sprites to make the input more diverse and challenging.
