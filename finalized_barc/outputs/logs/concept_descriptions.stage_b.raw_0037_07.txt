Here's a new puzzle implementation based on the provided description. The goal is to navigate a path on a grid, avoiding obstacles, and making consistent turns when encountering them.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# obstacle navigation, fixed direction turn, pathfinding

# description:
# The input grid contains a colored path and obstacles. You start from a specific point and move along the path in a set direction.
# When an obstacle is encountered, you turn in the specified direction ('left' or 'right') and continue until the path clears.
# Resume the original direction after passing the obstacle. The output grid shows the path with detours around obstacles,
# consistently turning the specified way.

def main(input_grid):
    # Plan:
    # 1. Identify the start point and the initial direction
    # 2. Navigate the path while encountering obstacles, making turns as specified
    # 3. Return the grid with the completed path

    # Set up the colors and initial direction
    path_color = Color.RED
    obstacle_color = Color.GREY
    start_color = Color.GREEN
    direction = 'right'  # or 'left', depending on the puzzle specification

    # Determine the initial starting point and direction based on the input grid
    start_objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, monochromatic=True)
    start_object = [obj for obj in start_objects if start_color in object_colors(obj)][0]
    x, y = object_position(start_object, anchor="center")

    # Define the initial movement direction (e.g., right)
    move_direction = (0, 1)  # moving right initially

    def turn_left(direction):
        # Define how to turn left based on current direction
        dx, dy = direction
        return (-dy, dx)

    def turn_right(direction):
        # Define how to turn right based on current direction
        dx, dy = direction
        return (dy, -dx)

    # Create a copy of the input grid for output
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # Navigate the path
    while True:
        # Check if the current position is valid
        if not (0 <= x < input_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= y < input_grid.shape[1]):
            break

        # Mark the path on the output grid
        output_grid[x, y] = path_color

        # Move in the current direction
        next_x, next_y = x + move_direction[0], y + move_direction[1]

        # Check for obstacles
        if (0 <= next_x < input_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= next_y < input_grid.shape[1]) and input_grid[next_x, next_y] == obstacle_color:
            # Turn in the specified direction
            if direction == 'left':
                move_direction = turn_left(move_direction)
            else:  # direction == 'right'
                move_direction = turn_right(move_direction)
        else:
            # No obstacle, continue in the same direction
            x, y = next_x, next_y

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate an input grid with a path and obstacles

    # Define grid size
    n = np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((n, n), Color.BLACK)

    # Define colors
    path_color = Color.RED
    obstacle_color = Color.GREY
    start_color = Color.GREEN

    # Create a path
    x, y = np.random.randint(1, n-1), np.random.randint(1, n-1)
    grid[x, y] = start_color

    # Generate a random path
    for _ in range(np.random.randint(5, 10)):
        direction = np.random.choice([(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)])
        length = np.random.randint(2, 5)
        x, y = draw_line(grid, x, y, length=length, direction=direction, color=path_color, stop_at_color=[obstacle_color])

    # Place obstacles randomly

        ox, oy = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, n)

### Explanation:
1. **Concepts**: This puzzle involves navigating a grid with obstacles, making turns in specified directions, and ensuring a consistent path finding.
2. **Description**: The grid contains a path and obstacles. Starting from a designated point, the path is navigated by avoiding obstacles and making consistent turns. The output is a grid showing the path with detours around obstacles.
3. **Main Function**: It includes identifying the starting point and direction, navigating the path, and making turns as specified.
4. **Generate Input**: Randomly creates a grid with a path colored in red and obstacles in grey. The path starts from a green point and includes random turns and obstacles.
