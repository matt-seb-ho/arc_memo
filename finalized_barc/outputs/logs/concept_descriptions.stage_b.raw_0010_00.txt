Here's a new puzzle implementation based on the provided description. This puzzle involves identifying a guide object within a grid and using its position as the starting point for a transformation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, starting point, position-based transformation

# description:
# In the input grid, there is a unique guide object represented by a distinct color (TEAL).
# The task is to identify this guide object and use its position to perform a transformation.
# Specifically, the transformation involves creating a radial gradient of colors around the guide object
# in the output grid. The colors in the radial gradient should be chosen randomly from the available colors,
# excluding BLACK and TEAL, and should change with increasing distance from the guide object.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find the guide object in the grid (TEAL colored)
    guide_object = detect_objects(grid=input_grid, colors=[Color.TEAL], monochromatic=True, connectivity=8)[0]
    
    # Get the position of the guide object
    guide_x, guide_y, *_ = bounding_box(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    # Create an output grid of the same size as the input grid
    output_grid = np.full_like(input_grid, Color.BLACK)

    # Define the available colors for the radial gradient, excluding BLACK and TEAL
    available_colors = [color for color in Color.NOT_BLACK if color != Color.TEAL]

    # Fill the output grid with a radial gradient centered at the guide object's position
    n, m = input_grid.shape
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            # Calculate the distance from the guide object
            distance = int(np.sqrt((i - guide_x) ** 2 + (j - guide_y) ** 2))
            # Choose a color based on the distance
            color = available_colors[distance % len(available_colors)]
            output_grid[i, j] = color

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid with a unique TEAL colored guide object
    n, m = np.random.randint(5, 10), np.random.randint(5, 10)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK, dtype=int)
    
    # Randomly place a TEAL colored pixel as the guide object
    guide_x, guide_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    grid[guide_x, guide_y] = Color.TEAL

    # Optionally, add some random colored pixels around the grid
    num_random_pixels = np.random.randint(0, 5)
    for _ in range(num_random_pixels):
        rx, ry = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
        if (rx, ry) != (guide_x, guide_y):
            grid[rx, ry] = np.random.choice([c for c in Color.NOT_BLACK if c != Color.TEAL])
    
    return grid
```

This puzzle challenges students to identify the guide object and use its position to create a radial gradient transformation. The `generate_input` function ensures that each input grid has a unique TEAL colored pixel serving as the guide object, while `main` applies the transformation by filling the grid with a radial gradient of colors.
