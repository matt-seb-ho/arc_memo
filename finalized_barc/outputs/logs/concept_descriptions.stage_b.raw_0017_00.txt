Here's a new puzzle idea based on the description you provided:

# Puzzle Overview:
The puzzle involves identifying and highlighting holes within a single object in a grid. The object is surrounded by a background of black pixels (0s). Holes are defined as fully enclosed regions of black pixels within the object that are not connected to the grid's border. The task is to identify these enclosed regions and change their color to highlight them in the output grid.

# Puzzle Code:
```python
from common import *
import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# holes, enclosed regions, flood-fill, background components

# description:
# Input consists of a grid with a single object and background (0). Identify holes as fully enclosed 0-regions within the object that are not connected to the grid border.
# Use flood-fill from the border to detect and exclude non-enclosed regions. The output grid highlights these enclosed holes with a distinct color, such as blue.

def main(input_grid):
    # Create an initial copy of the input grid to store the result
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # Find the boundary of the grid
    n, m = input_grid.shape

    # Use flood-fill to mark connected components from the border
    border_connected = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=bool)

    def flood_fill(x, y):
        if x < 0 or x >= n or y < 0 or y >= m:
            return
        if input_grid[x, y] != 0 or border_connected[x, y]:
            return
        border_connected[x, y] = True
        flood_fill(x + 1, y)
        flood_fill(x - 1, y)
        flood_fill(x, y + 1)
        flood_fill(x, y - 1)

    # Apply flood fill from the border
    for i in range(n):
        flood_fill(i, 0)
        flood_fill(i, m - 1)
    for j in range(m):
        flood_fill(0, j)
        flood_fill(n - 1, j)

    # Highlight the enclosed holes
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            if input_grid[x, y] == 0 and not border_connected[x, y]:
                output_grid[x, y] = Color.BLUE  # Highlight enclosed holes

    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with a single object
    n, m = np.random.randint(12, 20, size=2)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a random object
    obj_n, obj_m = np.random.randint(6, min(n, m) - 2, size=2)
    obj_x, obj_y = np.random.randint(1, n - obj_n), np.random.randint(1, m - obj_m)

    grid[obj_x:obj_x + obj_n, obj_y:obj_y + obj_m] = Color.RED

    # Add random holes within the object
    num_holes = np.random.randint(1, 4)
    for _ in range(num_holes):
        hole_n, hole_m = np.random.randint(2, min(obj_n, obj_m) // 2, size=2)
        hole_x, hole_y = np.random.randint(obj_x + 1, obj_x + obj_n - hole_n), np.random.randint(obj_y + 1, obj_y + obj_m - hole_m)
        grid[hole_x:hole_x + hole_n, hole_y:hole_y + hole_m] = Color.BLACK

    return grid
```

# Explanation:
1. **Concepts**: This puzzle involves detecting enclosed regions (holes) within an object by using flood-fill from the grid's border. The main challenge is distinguishing between holes that are enclosed versus those connected to the border.

2. **Main Function**: The `main` function applies flood-fill from the grid's border to mark black regions connected to the border. It then highlights the regions that are still black but not connected to the border as enclosed holes.

3. **Generate Input**: The `generate_input` function creates a grid containing a single object with random dimensions and positions. It also randomly creates holes within the object, ensuring they are not connected to the object's edge, to simulate enclosed regions.

This puzzle challenges students to understand grid-based algorithms, specifically flood-fill, and concepts of connectivity and enclosure within a grid.
