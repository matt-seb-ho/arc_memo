Certainly! Based on the provided description for the new puzzle, let's implement the solution. The puzzle consists of identifying and selecting all objects that are composed entirely of a specified target color, and preserving only those objects while setting all other grid cells to a background color (0).

Here's the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# specific color selection, connected components, filtering

# description:
# The input consists of a grid with multiple objects of various colors.
# A target color is specified, and the task is to identify and select all objects that are entirely composed of this target color.
# The output is a grid where only these selected objects are preserved in their original positions and colors, 
# while all other grid cells are set to the background color (0).

def main(input_grid: np.ndarray, target_color: str) -> np.ndarray:
    # Plan:
    # 1. Extract all connected components in the grid.
    # 2. Filter out components that are not entirely composed of the target color.
    # 3. Create an output grid where only the selected components are preserved.

    # 1. Extract all connected components in the grid
    components = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)
    
    # 2. Filter out components that are not entirely composed of the target color
    selected_components = [comp for comp in components if np.all(comp[comp != Color.BLACK] == target_color)]

    # 3. Create an output grid
    output_grid = np.full_like(input_grid, Color.BLACK)

    # Place the selected components into the output grid
    for comp in selected_components:
        output_grid = blit_object(output_grid, comp, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid


def generate_input() -> Tuple[np.ndarray, str]:
    # Create a grid with multiple objects of various colors
    n, m = 10, 10
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Select a target color randomly
    target_color = random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))

    # Generate and place objects of various colors
    for _ in range(np.random.randint(5, 10)):
        color = random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
        obj = random_sprite(list(range(2, 4)), list(range(2, 4)), color_palette=[color])
        
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, obj, padding=1)
            grid = blit_sprite(grid, obj, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
        except ValueError:
            break

    # Add at least one object entirely composed of the target color
    while True:
        obj = random_sprite(list(range(2, 4)), list(range(2, 4)), color_palette=[target_color])
        x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, obj, padding=1)
        if not collision(object1=grid, object2=obj, x2=x, y2=y):
            grid = blit_sprite(grid, obj, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
            break

    return grid, target_color
```

### Explanation

- **`main` function**:
  - It identifies all connected components in the input grid.
  - It selects those components that are entirely composed of the specified target color.
  - It places these components into an output grid, setting all other cells to the background color.

- **`generate_input` function**:
  - It creates a stochastic input grid with multiple objects of different colors.
  - It ensures at least one object is entirely composed of the specified target color, which is chosen randomly.
  - It returns both the input grid and the target color as a tuple.
