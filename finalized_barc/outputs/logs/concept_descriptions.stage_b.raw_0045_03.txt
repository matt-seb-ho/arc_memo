Here's an implementation of the described puzzle, where the goal is to find the first 3x3 window that contains at least one cell of every color specified in a given set of required colors.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
import random
from typing import *

# description:
# Input is a grid with various colors. Slide a 3x3 window over the grid. Identify the first window that contains at least one cell of every color specified in a given set of required colors. Output the coordinates of this window. The task is to locate a heterogeneous anchor window based on color presence criteria.

def main(input_grid: np.ndarray, required_colors: Set[str]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    
    # Slide a 3x3 window over the grid
    for i in range(rows - 2):
        for j in range(cols - 2):
            # Extract the current 3x3 window
            window = input_grid[i:i+3, j:j+3]
            # Find unique colors in the current window
            unique_colors_in_window = set(np.unique(window))
            
            # Check if all required colors are present in the window
            if required_colors.issubset(unique_colors_in_window):
                return (i, j)
    
    # Return None if no valid window is found (although it's assumed one will be present in the puzzle)
    return None

def generate_input() -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Set[str]]:
    # Define grid size
    grid_size = random.randint(5, 10)
    grid = np.empty((grid_size, grid_size), dtype=object)
    
    # Fill the grid with random colors
    for i in range(grid_size):
        for j in range(grid_size):
            grid[i, j] = random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    # Select a random set of required colors
    required_colors = set(random.sample(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), random.randint(3, 5)))
    
    # Ensure at least one 3x3 window meets the required colors condition
    # Randomly choose a starting position for this window
    start_x = random.randint(0, grid_size - 3)
    start_y = random.randint(0, grid_size - 3)
    
    # Fill this window with at least the required colors
    for color in required_colors:
        rand_x = start_x + random.randint(0, 2)
        rand_y = start_y + random.randint(0, 2)
        grid[rand_x, rand_y] = color
    
    return grid, required_colors
```

### Explanation

- **`main` function**:
  - We iterate over all possible positions for a 3x3 window in the grid.
  - For each window, we extract the colors present and check if all required colors are present.
  - If a window satisfies the condition, we return its top-left coordinates.

- **`generate_input` function**:
  - We create a grid of random colors, ensuring it's large enough to have at least one valid 3x3 window.
  - We randomly select a set of required colors.
  - We ensure at least one 3x3 window in the grid contains all required colors by manually placing them.

This setup ensures a puzzle where the player must identify a particular pattern (presence of required colors) within a grid using a sliding window technique.
