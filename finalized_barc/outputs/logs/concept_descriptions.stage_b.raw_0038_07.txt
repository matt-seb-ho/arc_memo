Here is a new puzzle implementation based on the provided description:

import numpy as np

# concepts:
# object selection, connected components, filtering

# description:
# The input grid consists of various colored objects on a black background. Each object is a connected component of the same color.
# The task is to extract all connected components and retain only those that fulfill a specific condition.
# The output should be a list of selected objects, each represented by its bounding box and constituent pixels. Non-selected objects are excluded.

def main(input_grid):
    # Extract connected components from the input grid
    connected_components = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)

    # Define the selection criterion: Select objects with an area greater than a specific threshold
    area_threshold = 5  # Example threshold

    selected_objects = []
    for component in connected_components:
        # Calculate the area of the component
        area = np.sum(component != Color.BLACK)

        # Apply the selection criterion
        if area > area_threshold:
            # Crop the component to its bounding box
            cropped_component = crop(component, background=Color.BLACK)

            # Add the cropped component to the list of selected objects
            selected_objects.append(cropped_component)

    return selected_objects


def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of a random size between 10x10 and 15x15
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 16), np.random.randint(10, 16)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a random number of objects
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)

    for _ in range(num_objects):
        # Generate a random sprite with random dimensions and color
        sprite_n, sprite_m = np.random.randint(2, 5), np.random.randint(2, 5)
        color = random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
        sprite = random_sprite(n=sprite_n, m=sprite_m, color_palette=[color], connectivity=8)

        # Try to find a random free location for the sprite
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1, padding_connectivity=8, border_size=1, background=Color.BLACK)
            blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
        except ValueError:
            continue  # If no space is found, skip this sprite

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **Concepts**:
   - **Object selection**: Each object is a connected component of the same color.
   - **Connected components**: Treats objects as regions of contiguous non-black pixels.
   - **Filtering**: Applies a selection criterion to filter objects based on their area.

2. **Description**:
   - **Input**: A grid with multiple colored objects on a black background.
   - **Transformation**: Extract connected components, filter them based on a specified criterion (e.g., area > threshold).
   - **Output**: A list of selected objects, each represented by its bounding box and constituent pixels.

This puzzle challenges students to understand and apply concepts related to connected components, criteria-based filtering, and object representation on a grid.
