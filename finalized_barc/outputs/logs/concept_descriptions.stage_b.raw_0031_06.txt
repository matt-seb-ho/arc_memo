Certainly! Let's design a new puzzle based on the given description and using the common library functions. The puzzle will involve identifying a connected component, translating it, and redrawing it at a new location.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# object identification, translation, erasure, grid manipulation

# description:
# Identify a single connected component (object) within the input grid. Determine its bounding box and erase the object by setting its pixels to the background color (0).
# Translate the object to a specified new position (row, column) by moving its bounding box to the new coordinates.
# Redraw the object at the new position, preserving its shape and color. The output grid reflects the object moved to the new location with its original position cleared.

def main(input_grid):
    # Create a copy of the input grid for manipulation
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Identify connected components in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(output_grid, background=Color.BLACK, monochromatic=True, connectivity=8)
    
    # Assume there is only one object
    assert len(objects) == 1
    obj = objects[0]
    
    # Determine the bounding box of the object
    x, y, width, height = bounding_box(obj, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    # Erase the object from its original position
    output_grid[x:x+width, y:y+height] = Color.BLACK
    
    # Translate the object to a new position
    new_x, new_y = np.random.randint(0, output_grid.shape[0] - width), np.random.randint(0, output_grid.shape[1] - height)
    
    # Create a cropped version of the object to be redrawn
    sprite = crop(obj, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    # Redraw the object at the new position
    blit_sprite(output_grid, sprite, new_x, new_y, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a random grid size
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 15), np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Generate a random sprite (object) with random dimensions and color
    width, height = np.random.randint(3, 5), np.random.randint(3, 5)
    color = random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    sprite = random_sprite(width, height, color_palette=[color], background=Color.BLACK)
    
    # Find a random free location for the sprite in the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, background=Color.BLACK, padding=1, border_size=1)
    
    # Place the sprite onto the grid
    blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    return grid
```

### Explanation:
1. **Main Function**:
   - We find the connected components in the grid and assume there is only one object.
   - We determine its bounding box and erase its original location by setting these pixels to the background color.
   - We translate the object to a new random position that fits within the grid dimensions.
   - The object is redrawn at the new position using `blit_sprite`.

2. **Generate Input Function**:
   - We create a grid of random size and generate a random sprite with random dimensions and color.
   - The sprite is placed randomly on the grid using `random_free_location_for_sprite` ensuring it fits and does not collide with the grid's borders.
   - This setup ensures that each generated puzzle instance is unique and provides different challenges. 

This puzzle teaches kids about object translation and grid manipulation, enhancing their understanding of spatial transformations.
