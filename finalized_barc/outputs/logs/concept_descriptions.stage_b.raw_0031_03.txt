Let's create a puzzle based on the idea of identifying and manipulating connected components in a grid. The puzzle will focus on object identification, translation, erasure, and grid manipulation.

### Puzzle Description:

**Concepts:**
- Object identification
- Bounding box calculation
- Object translation
- Erasure

**Description:**
The input is a grid with a single connected object of random color among a black background. The task is to identify the object's bounding box, erase it from its original position, and then translate it to a new specified position on the grid. The new position will be provided as part of the input, and the object must maintain its original shape and colors after being moved.

Here's how you might implement this puzzle:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# object identification, translation, erasure, grid manipulation

# description:
# Identify a single connected component (object) within the input grid. Determine its bounding box and erase the object by setting its pixels to the background color (0).
# Translate the object to a specified new position (row, column) by moving its bounding box to the new coordinates.
# Redraw the object at the new position, preserving its shape and color. The output grid reflects the object moved to the new location with its original position cleared.

def main(input_grid, new_position):
    # Plan:
    # 1. Extract the single object from the input grid
    # 2. Calculate the bounding box of the object
    # 3. Erase the object from its original position
    # 4. Move the object to the new position
    # 5. Return the modified grid

    background_color = Color.BLACK

    # Extract the connected component (object) from the input grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=background_color, connectivity=4, monochromatic=False)
    assert len(objects) == 1, "There should be exactly one object in the input grid."

    # Get the object and its bounding box
    obj = objects[0]
    x, y, width, height = bounding_box(obj, background=background_color)

    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Erase the object from its original position
    output_grid[x:x + width, y:y + height] = background_color

    # Calculate the new position to translate the object to
    new_x, new_y = new_position

    # Translate the object and blit it onto the output grid at the new position
    translated_obj = translate(obj, new_x - x, new_y - y, background=background_color)
    blit_object(output_grid, translated_obj, background=background_color)

    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with a single random object
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 15), np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a random sprite (object)
    sprite_width, sprite_height = np.random.randint(2, 5), np.random.randint(2, 5)
    sprite_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    sprite = random_sprite(sprite_width, sprite_height, color_palette=[sprite_color], background=Color.BLACK)

    # Find a random free location for the sprite on the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, background=Color.BLACK, padding=1)

    # Blit the sprite onto the grid
    blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Determine a new random position for the object to be moved to
    new_x, new_y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1)

    return grid, (new_x, new_y)
```

### Explanation:
- **Object Identification**: We use `find_connected_components` to identify the object in the grid.
- **Bounding Box Calculation**: The `bounding_box` function is used to find the dimensions and location of the object.
- **Translation and Erasure**: The object is erased from its original position using a simple assignment of the background color. It is then translated to a new specified position using `translate` and `blit_object`.
- **Grid Manipulation**: The object is redrawn at the new location, ensuring it retains its original shape and color. The `generate_input` function creates random objects and determines a new position to which the object will be moved.
