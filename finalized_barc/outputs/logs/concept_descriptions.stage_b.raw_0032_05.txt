Certainly! Let's implement the puzzle where the task is to detect the missing corner of an L-shaped triomino on a 2x2 grid. The grid might contain some noise, but the L-shape is dominant. We'll classify the orientation based on which corner is unoccupied by the L-shape.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# L-shape detection, corner identification, orientation classification

# description:
# The input is a 2x2 grid with a dominant L-shaped triomino and some possible noise.
# The output should be a 1x1 grid with a pixel corresponding to the missing corner of the L-shape:
# "tl" for top-left, "tr" for top-right, "bl" for bottom-left, or "br" for bottom-right.

def main(input_grid):
    # Define the possible L-shape configurations
    l_shapes = {
        "tl": np.array([[0, 1], [1, 1]]),
        "tr": np.array([[1, 0], [1, 1]]),
        "bl": np.array([[1, 1], [0, 1]]),
        "br": np.array([[1, 1], [1, 0]])
    }
    
    # Detect the L-shape by matching the dominant pattern
    for orientation, pattern in l_shapes.items():
        if np.array_equal((input_grid != 0).astype(int), pattern):
            return np.array([[orientation]])

def generate_input():
    # Create a noise-infested 2x2 grid with a dominant L-shape
    background_color = Color.BLACK
    colors = list(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    
    # Randomly choose an L-shape orientation
    orientation = np.random.choice(["tl", "tr", "bl", "br"])
    
    # Create a blank 2x2 grid
    grid = np.full((2, 2), background_color)
    
    # Define the L-shape patterns
    l_patterns = {
        "tl": [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)],
        "tr": [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)],
        "bl": [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)],
        "br": [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]
    }
    
    # Add the L-shape to the grid using a random non-black color
    l_shape_color = np.random.choice(colors)
    for x, y in l_patterns[orientation]:
        grid[x, y] = l_shape_color
    
    # Add random noise (non-L-shape colors) with a low probability
    for i in range(2):
        for j in range(2):
            if grid[i, j] == background_color and np.random.rand() < 0.2:
                grid[i, j] = np.random.choice(colors)
    
    return grid
```

### Explanation:

- **Concepts:** This puzzle involves L-shape detection, corner identification, and orientation classification.
- **Description:** The task is to identify the missing corner of an L-shaped triomino on a 2x2 grid. The missing corner indicates the orientation of the L-shape, which should be identified as "tl" (top-left), "tr" (top-right), "bl" (bottom-left), or "br" (bottom-right).
- **`main` Function:** This function checks the input grid against known L-shape patterns to determine the missing corner and outputs the corresponding orientation.
- **`generate_input` Function:** This function randomly generates a 2x2 grid containing a randomly oriented L-shape and adds some noise with a low probability. The L-shape is implemented using a random non-black color from the available color palette.
