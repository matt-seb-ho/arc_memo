Here is the implementation of the puzzle that involves recoloring a target object to match the color of a guide object. The target object and the guide object are distinct and identifiable on a grid.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# recolor, guide object, connected components

# description:
# The input consists of a grid with at least two distinct objects: a target object and a guide object.
# Identify the target object and change its color to match the color of the guide object. The guide object is distinct 
# and serves as the reference for the new color. All other grid elements remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all the objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)

    # Assume the largest object is the guide object
    guide_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))

    # Determine the color of the guide object
    guide_color = input_grid[guide_object != Color.BLACK][0]

    # Assume the smallest object is the target object
    target_object = min(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))

    # Recolor the target object to match the guide object
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    target_coords = np.argwhere(target_object != Color.BLACK)
    for x, y in target_coords:
        output_grid[x, y] = guide_color

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of size 10x10
    grid = np.full((10, 10), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a guide object with a random color
    guide_color = random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    guide_object = random_sprite(3, 3, color_palette=[guide_color], connectivity=4)
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, padding=1, border_size=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a target object with a different random color
    target_color = random.choice([c for c in Color.NOT_BLACK if c != guide_color])
    target_object = random_sprite(2, 2, color_palette=[target_color], connectivity=4)
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, target_object, padding=1, border_size=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, target_object, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **Concepts**:
   - **Recolor**: Changing the color of the target object to match the guide object's color.
   - **Guide Object**: The object whose color will be used as the reference.
   - **Connected Components**: Identifying distinct objects in the grid.

2. **Description**:
   - The input grid contains a target object and a guide object.
   - The task is to identify these objects, recolor the target object to match the guide object's color, and leave all other elements unchanged.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Use `find_connected_components` to identify separate objects within the grid.
   - Assume the largest object as the guide object to determine its color.
   - Assume the smallest object as the target object that needs to be recolored.
   - Use `blit_sprite` and `random_free_location_for_sprite` in `generate_input` to place objects without overlap.

This puzzle challenges students to understand connected components and recoloring based on a given reference.
