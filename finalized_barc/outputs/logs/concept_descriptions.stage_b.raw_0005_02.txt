Certainly! Here is the implementation of the puzzle based on the provided description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, color propagation, hole filling

# description:
# Identify a guide object by its unique color in the grid. Use this color to fill all enclosed regions (holes) within the grid.
# A hole is defined as a region of background (0) pixels completely surrounded by non-background pixels. The guide object's color is propagated to fill these holes, ensuring that all other non-hole areas remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Identify the guide object by its unique color
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)
    guide_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))
    guide_color = object_colors(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)[0]

    # Create an output grid to store the result
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # Find all holes in the grid
    interior_mask = object_interior(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK)
    boundary_mask = object_boundary(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK)
    holes_mask = interior_mask & ~boundary_mask

    # Fill the holes with the guide object's color
    for x, y in np.argwhere(holes_mask):
        if input_grid[x, y] == Color.BLACK:
            output_grid[x, y] = guide_color

    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Generate a random grid size
    size = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    grid = np.full((size, size), Color.BLACK)

    # Add random objects of different colors
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        width, height = np.random.randint(3, 6), np.random.randint(3, 6)
        color = np.random.choice([color for color in Color.NOT_BLACK])

        sprite = random_sprite(width, height, color_palette=[color], connectivity=8, background=Color.BLACK)
        x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1, border_size=1, background=Color.BLACK)
        blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Select one object to be the guide object and ensure it fully encloses a hole
    guide_object = random_sprite(4, 4, color_palette=[Color.TEAL], connectivity=8, background=Color.BLACK)
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, padding=1, border_size=1, background=Color.BLACK)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Create a hole inside the guide object
    hole_x, hole_y = x + 1, y + 1
    grid[hole_x:hole_x+2, hole_y:hole_y+2] = Color.BLACK

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **`main` Function:**
    - The function begins by identifying a guide object from the connected components in the grid. The guide object is the largest object by pixel count and is assumed to have a unique color.
    - The guide object's color is then used to fill all enclosed holes (regions of black pixels fully surrounded by non-black pixels) within the grid.
    - This is achieved by identifying the interior (enclosed) regions and excluding the boundaries of all objects.

2. **`generate_input` Function:**
    - This function generates a random grid with randomly placed objects of different colors.
    - One object is designated as the guide object with a specific color (e.g., TEAL).
    - A hole is intentionally left inside this guide object to ensure that there is at least one enclosed region for the transformation to act upon.

This puzzle encourages logical reasoning to understand how the deterministic transformation fills enclosed spaces based on the guide object's color.
