Let's implement the puzzle as described. We need to detect an L-shaped triomino within a 2x2 grid and determine which corner is unoccupied. The output should be one of "tl", "tr", "bl", or "br" corresponding to the missing corner.

Here's how we can implement this:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# L-shape detection, corner identification, orientation classification

# description:
# Input is a 3-pixel L-shaped triomino on a 2x2 grid. Identify which of the four corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) is unoccupied by the L-shape.
# Output the orientation as one of "tl", "tr", "bl", or "br" corresponding to the missing corner. The grid may contain noise, but the L-shape is dominant.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find the coordinates of the colored pixels in the grid
    non_black_coords = np.argwhere(input_grid != Color.BLACK)
    
    # Check for the missing corner by identifying which corner does not have a pixel
    corners = {
        "tl": (0, 0),
        "tr": (0, 1),
        "bl": (1, 0),
        "br": (1, 1)
    }
    
    # Determine the missing corner
    for corner, coord in corners.items():
        if not any((coord == non_black_coord).all() for non_black_coord in non_black_coords):
            return np.array([[corner]])
    
    return np.array([["unknown"]])  # default case, should not happen if inputs are valid

def generate_input():
    # Create a 2x2 grid
    grid = np.full((2, 2), Color.BLACK, dtype=int)
    
    # Choose one corner to be the missing corner
    missing_corner = np.random.choice(["tl", "tr", "bl", "br"])
    
    # Define the L-shape by filling the grid except the chosen missing corner
    corners = {
        "tl": [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)],
        "tr": [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)],
        "bl": [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)],
        "br": [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]
    }
    
    # Fill the grid according to the L-shape
    fill_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    for coord in corners[missing_corner]:
        grid[coord] = fill_color
    
    # Add some noise if desired (not necessary for the puzzle, but could be added to increase difficulty)
    noise_level = np.random.choice([0, 0, 1])  # 0 or 1 extra noise pixels
    for _ in range(noise_level):
        x, y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=2)
        if grid[x, y] == Color.BLACK:
            grid[x, y] = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    return grid
```

In this implementation:
- The `main` function detects the coordinates of the colored pixels, then checks which of the four corners is missing a colored pixel and returns that corner's identifier.
- The `generate_input` function creates a 2x2 grid, determines which corner will be missing based on a random choice, fills the remaining pixels to form an L-shape, and occasionally adds noise pixels to increase complexity.
