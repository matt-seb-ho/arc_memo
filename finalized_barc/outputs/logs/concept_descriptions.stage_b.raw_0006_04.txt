Let's implement the puzzle as described. We'll create a grid where two distinct pixels are marked as start and end, and we need to draw a straight line between these two points using a specified color. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

Here's how we can implement it:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# line drawing, pixel connectivity, grid update

# description:
# In the input you will see a grid with two distinct colored pixels: one for the start and another for the end.
# The task is to draw a straight line connecting these two pixels using a specified color.
# The line should be drawn using pixel connectivity, updating the grid by coloring each pixel along the path with the given color.
# The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Copy the input grid to create the output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Identify start and end positions
    start_position = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.GREEN)[0]
    end_position = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.RED)[0]

    # Draw a line between the start and end positions using a specified color
    draw_line(output_grid, x=start_position[0], y=start_position[1],
              end_x=end_position[0], end_y=end_position[1], color=Color.BLUE)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of random size between 10x10 and 20x20
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 21, size=2)
    grid = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)

    # Randomly place a start pixel (GREEN) and an end pixel (RED) on the grid
    start_x, start_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)

    # Ensure start and end positions are not the same
    while start_x == end_x and start_y == end_y:
        end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)

    # Assign colors to start and end positions
    grid[start_x, start_y] = Color.GREEN
    grid[end_x, end_y] = Color.RED

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

- **Concepts:** This puzzle involves concepts of line drawing, pixel connectivity, and grid updates.
  
- **Description:** The input grid contains two distinct colored pixels marked as the start (GREEN) and end (RED). The task is to draw a straight line connecting these two points using a specified color (BLUE). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

- **Functions Used:**
  - `np.copy`: To create a copy of the input grid for manipulation.
  - `np.argwhere`: To find the positions of the start and end pixels on the grid.
  - `draw_line`: To draw a line between the start and end positions.

- **`generate_input`:** This function generates a randomized grid with a start and an end pixel placed randomly, ensuring they are not at the same position. This provides a variety of scenarios for the `main` function to handle.

This implementation allows middle-schoolers to explore the concept of drawing lines on a grid, focusing on the connectivity between pixels.
