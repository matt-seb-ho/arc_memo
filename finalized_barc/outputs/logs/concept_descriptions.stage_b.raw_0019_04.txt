Certainly! The new puzzle involves identifying a unique colored object in a grid and preserving it while leaving all other objects unchanged. Let's implement this puzzle as described:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# unique color identification, guide object selection, connected components

# description:
# The input consists of multiple distinct objects on a grid, each with a unique color.
# Identify the guide object as the one whose color is not shared by any other object in the grid.
# The output is a transformation where the guide object is preserved based on its unique color,
# while all other objects remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Extract all objects from the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, monochromatic=True, connectivity=8)

    # Count the occurrences of each color
    color_count = {}
    for obj in objects:
        color = object_colors(obj)[0]
        if color not in color_count:
            color_count[color] = 0
        color_count[color] += 1

    # Identify the unique guide object
    guide_object = None
    for obj in objects:
        color = object_colors(obj)[0]
        if color_count[color] == 1:
            guide_object = obj
            break

    # Create a blank output grid
    output_grid = np.full_like(input_grid, Color.BLACK)

    # Blit all objects onto the output grid keeping their original state
    for obj in objects:
        if obj is guide_object:
            blit_object(output_grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK)
        else:
            blit_object(output_grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid size
    width, height = np.random.randint(10, 15), np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((width, height), Color.BLACK)

    # Choose a random color for the unique guide object
    unique_color = random.choice(list(Color.ALL_COLORS))

    # Create the unique guide object
    guide_sprite = random_sprite(n=[2, 3, 4], m=[2, 3, 4], color_palette=[unique_color])
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, x, y)

    # Create other objects with non-unique colors
    for _ in range(np.random.randint(3, 6)):
        # Choose a color different from the unique color
        object_color = random.choice([color for color in Color.ALL_COLORS if color != unique_color])
        sprite = random_sprite(n=[2, 3, 4], m=[2, 3, 4], color_palette=[object_color])
        x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1, padding=1)
        blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
- **`main` Function**: This function first identifies all objects and counts the color occurrences to find the unique guide object with a color that appears only once. It then creates an output grid where only the guide object is preserved in its original state.
- **`generate_input` Function**: This function generates a random grid where one object has a unique color, ensuring that other objects have different colors. This setup allows the puzzle solver to identify the unique guide object based on color uniqueness.

This puzzle challenges the solver to understand color uniqueness and connected component detection in a grid, using the provided utility functions from the `common.py` library.
