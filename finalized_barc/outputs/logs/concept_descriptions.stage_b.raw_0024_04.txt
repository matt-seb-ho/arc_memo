Certainly! Let's design a new puzzle based on the description provided:

# Puzzle Description:
- **Concepts:** Connected components, recoloring, color scheme, random color choice
- **Description:** Given a grid with colored objects, identify a single connected object. Apply a new color scheme to recolor the entire object. The color scheme may be a single color applied uniformly to the object. All other grid elements remain unchanged.

Here is the implementation of the puzzle:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# connected components, recoloring, color scheme

# description:
# In the input grid, you will see multiple colored objects.
# Identify one single connected object and recolor it with a randomly selected single color from the available color palette.
# All other grid elements remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all connected components in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=8)
    
    # Choose a single object to recolor
    selected_object = objects[0]  # Select the first object for simplicity
    
    # Choose a new color from the available palette, excluding black
    new_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    # Recolor the entire object with the new color
    selected_object[selected_object != Color.BLACK] = new_color
    
    # Create a copy of the input grid to form the output
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    
    # Apply the recolored object back onto the grid
    blit_object(output_grid, selected_object, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of size between 10x10 and 15x15
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 16), np.random.randint(10, 16)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Generate random objects with random colors
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        # Generate a random sprite with random color
        sprite_size = np.random.randint(3, 5)
        color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
        sprite = random_sprite(sprite_size, sprite_size, color_palette=[color], connectivity=8)
        
        # Place the sprite in a random location on the grid
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            # If unable to place the sprite, retry
            return generate_input()
    
    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **`main` function:**
   - It identifies all connected components in the input grid.
   - It selects the first object from the list of connected components for recoloring.
   - It chooses a new color randomly from the available colors (excluding black).
   - It recolors the selected object uniformly with the chosen color.
   - It places the recolored object back onto a copy of the input grid to form the output.

2. **`generate_input` function:**
   - It generates a grid of random size between 10x10 and 15x15.
   - It then generates a random number of colored objects with random colors (excluding black).
   - It attempts to place these objects randomly on the grid, ensuring they do not overlap.

This puzzle challenges the solver to identify and recolor a connected component while keeping the rest of the grid unchanged. The randomness in input generation ensures varied and interesting puzzle instances.
