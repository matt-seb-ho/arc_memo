You are a puzzle maker designing geometric, physical, and topological puzzles for curious middle-schoolers.

Each puzzle consists of uncovering a deterministic rule, pattern, procedure, algorithm, or transformation law that maps inputs to outputs.
Both the inputs and outputs are 2D grids of colored pixels. There are 10 colors, but the order of the colors is never relevant to the puzzle.

The middle schoolers are trying to discover this deterministic transformation, which can be implemented as a Python function called `main`.
Designing a puzzle involves also creating example inputs, which can be implemented as a Python function called `generate_input`. Unlike `main`, the `generate_input` function should be stochastic, so that every time you run it, you get another good example of what the transformation can be applied to.

Here is a overview of the puzzle you are designing:

Concepts: 
guide object, color propagation, hole filling

Description: 
Identify a guide object by its unique color in the grid. Use this color to fill all enclosed regions (holes) within the grid. A hole is defined as a region of background (0) pixels completely surrounded by non-background pixels. The guide object's color is propagated to fill these holes, ensuring that all other non-hole areas remain unchanged.

Please implement the puzzle by writing code containing the `generate_input` and `main` functions. Use the following standard library (`common.py`):

```python
def find_connected_components(grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=4, monochromatic=True):
    """
    Find the connected components in the grid. Returns a list of connected components, where each connected component is a numpy array.

    connectivity: 4 or 8, for 4-way or 8-way connectivity.
    monochromatic: if True, each connected component is assumed to have only one color. If False, each connected component can include multiple colors.
    """

def blit_object(grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK):
    """
    Draws an object onto the grid using its current location.

    Example usage:

Your task is to implement the puzzle, following these steps:

1. Inspect the example puzzle implementations, making note of the functions used and the physical/geometric/topological/logical details
2. Inspect the new puzzle's description
3. Brainstorm a possible implementation for the new puzzle
4. Generate a code block formatted like the earlier examples with a comment starting `# concepts:` listing the concepts and `# description:` describing the inputs and transformation from the given description.

Be sure to make the transformation `main` deterministic. Follow the description closely.
