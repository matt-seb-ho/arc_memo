Certainly! Let's design the puzzle based on the given description:

**Concepts:**
- Line drawing
- Pixel connectivity
- Grid update

**Description:**
Given a grid with two distinct pixels marked as start and end, draw a straight line connecting these two pixels using a specified color. The line is drawn using pixel connectivity, updating the grid by coloring each pixel along the path with the given color. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

Here's the implementation of the puzzle:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *


# concepts:
# line drawing, pixel connectivity, grid update

# description:
# Given a grid with two distinct pixels marked as start and end, draw a straight line connecting these two pixels
# using a specified color. The line is drawn using pixel connectivity, updating the grid by coloring each
# pixel along the path with the given color. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Copy the input grid to output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Find the start and end points
    start_x, start_y = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.GREEN)[0]
    end_x, end_y = np.argwhere(input_grid == Color.RED)[0]

    # Determine the line color, which is BLUE in this case
    line_color = Color.BLUE

    # Use Bresenham's line algorithm to draw a straight line between start and end
    dx = abs(end_x - start_x)
    dy = abs(end_y - start_y)
    sx = 1 if start_x < end_x else -1
    sy = 1 if start_y < end_y else -1
    err = dx - dy

    x, y = start_x, start_y
    while True:
        output_grid[x, y] = line_color
        if x == end_x and y == end_y:
            break
        e2 = 2 * err
        if e2 > -dy:
            err -= dy
            x += sx
        if e2 < dx:
            err += dx
            y += sy

    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of size 10x10
    grid_size = 10
    grid = np.zeros((grid_size, grid_size), dtype=int)

    # Randomly place start and end points
    start_x, start_y = np.random.randint(0, grid_size, 2)
    end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, grid_size, 2)

    # Ensure start and end points are not the same
    while (start_x == end_x) and (start_y == end_y):
        end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, grid_size, 2)

    # Place start and end points on the grid
    grid[start_x, start_y] = Color.GREEN
    grid[end_x, end_y] = Color.RED

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

- **`main` Function:**
  - Copies the input grid to the `output_grid`.
  - Finds the coordinates of the start (green) and end (red) points.
  - Uses Bresenham's line algorithm to draw a straight line between the start and end points, coloring the path with a specified color (blue).

- **`generate_input` Function:**
  - Generates a 10x10 grid with all black pixels.
  - Places two distinct colored pixels, one green (start) and one red (end), at random positions.
  - Ensures start and end points are not the same to form a valid line.

This puzzle challenges students to understand how to connect two points with a line on a grid, taking into account pixel connectivity and determining the transformation rule.
