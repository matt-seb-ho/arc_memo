Let's implement the new puzzle based on the description:

**Concepts:**
- Hole filling
- Guide object
- Target object
- Enclosed regions
- Non-overlapping placement

**Description:**
The input consists of a guide object with enclosed holes and a separate target object. Identify interior holes within the guide object (regions not connected to the border). Fill these holes using the target object by fitting its pixels or blocks into the hole geometry without overlapping existing non-background pixels. Continue filling until all holes are filled or no more legal placements are possible. The output grid shows previously empty regions inside the guide object filled with the target object's pixels.

Here's how the puzzle implementation will look:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# hole filling, guide object, target object, enclosed regions, non-overlapping placement

# description:
# The input consists of a guide object with enclosed holes and a separate target object. 
# Identify interior holes within the guide object (regions not connected to the border). 
# Fill these holes using the target object by fitting its pixels or blocks into the hole geometry without overlapping existing non-background pixels. 
# Continue filling until all holes are filled or no more legal placements are possible. 
# The output grid shows previously empty regions inside the guide object filled with the target object's pixels.

def main(input_grid):
    # Separate the guide object and the target object
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=4, monochromatic=False)
    guide_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))
    target_object = min(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))

    # Find the interior holes of the guide object
    guide_interior = object_interior(guide_object)

    # Initialize output grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # Try to fill the holes with the target object
    for x, y in np.argwhere(guide_interior):
        # Check if the target object can be placed at this position
        try:
            blit_sprite(output_grid, target_object, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
            # Check for overlaps
            if np.any((output_grid != input_grid) & (input_grid != Color.BLACK)):
                # Revert blit if overlap occurs
                blit_sprite(output_grid, np.full(target_object.shape, Color.BLACK), x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
        except ValueError:
            # If placement isn't possible, continue to the next position
            continue

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create grid size
    size = np.random.randint(12, 20)
    grid = np.full((size, size), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a guide object with holes
    guide_size = np.random.randint(8, 12)
    guide_obj = np.full((guide_size, guide_size), Color.BLUE)
    guide_obj[1:-1, 1:-1] = Color.BLACK

    # Create holes inside the guide object
    num_holes = np.random.randint(1, 3)
    for _ in range(num_holes):
        hole_size = np.random.randint(2, 4)
        hole_x, hole_y = np.random.randint(1, guide_size - hole_size - 1), np.random.randint(1, guide_size - hole_size - 1)
        guide_obj[hole_x:hole_x + hole_size, hole_y:hole_y + hole_size] = Color.BLACK

    # Place the guide object on the grid
    guide_x, guide_y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_obj, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_obj, guide_x, guide_y, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a target object
    target_size = np.random.randint(2, 4)
    target_obj = random_sprite(target_size, target_size, color_palette=[Color.RED, Color.YELLOW], background=Color.BLACK)

    # Place the target object randomly on the grid
    target_x, target_y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, target_obj, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, target_obj, target_x, target_y, background=Color.BLACK)

    return grid
```

This implementation ensures that the holes within a guide object are filled using a target object, with careful attention to fitting and avoiding overlaps. The `generate_input` function creates diverse inputs with different guide and target object configurations each time it is run.
