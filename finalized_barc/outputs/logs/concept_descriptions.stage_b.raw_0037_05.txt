Here's an implementation for the new puzzle based on the provided description:

# concepts:
# obstacle navigation, fixed direction turn, pathfinding

# description:
# Input is a grid with a path and obstacles. Starting from a given point, navigate the path until an obstacle is encountered.
# When an obstacle is hit, turn in the specified direction ('left' or 'right') and continue moving until the path is clear. 
# Resume the original direction once past the obstacle. The output grid shows the path with consistent detours around obstacles, always turning the same way as specified.

def main(input_grid):
    # Plan:
    # 1. Identify the starting point and the initial direction.
    # 2. Traverse the path while checking for obstacles.
    # 3. When an obstacle is encountered, turn in the specified direction ('left' or 'right').
    # 4. Continue moving in the new direction until the path is clear.
    # 5. Return to the original direction and continue traversal.
    # 6. Mark the traversed path on the output grid.

    # Colors in the grid
    path_color = Color.YELLOW

    direction = (direction_pos - start_pos).flatten()
    direction = tuple(direction)

    # Set the turn direction
    turn_direction = 'right'  # or 'left'

    # Function to turn left or right
    def turn(current_direction, turn_direction):
        if turn_direction == 'right':
            return (current_direction[1], -current_direction[0])
        elif turn_direction == 'left':
            return (-current_direction[1], current_direction[0])
        return current_direction

                direction = turn(direction, turn_direction)

```

### Explanation:

- **Main Function**: 
  - The `main` function navigates a path in the grid, turning at obstacles and resuming the original direction once clear.
  - It uses a simple directional vector to track movement and a function to handle turning based on a fixed direction ('left' or 'right').
  - The path is marked using the `path_color`.

- **Generate Input Function**: 
  - This function creates an input grid with a start point, initial direction, obstacles, and a path. 
  - Obstacles and paths are randomly placed for variety in each generated input.
  
This setup should provide a challenging yet understandable puzzle for middle-schoolers, focusing on navigation and obstacle avoidance.
