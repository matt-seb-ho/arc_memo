Here is the implementation of the puzzle described:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# line drawing, pixel connectivity, grid update

# description:
# In the input, you will see a grid with two distinct pixels marked as start and end.
# To make the output, draw a straight line connecting these two pixels using a specified color.
# The line is drawn using pixel connectivity, updating the grid by coloring each pixel along the path with the given color. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Copy the input grid to the output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Locate the start and end points based on unique colors
    start_color = None
    end_color = None
    for color in np.unique(input_grid):
        if np.sum(input_grid == color) == 1:
            if start_color is None:
                start_color = color
            else:
                end_color = color
                break

    # Get the positions of the start and end points
    start_x, start_y = np.where(input_grid == start_color)
    end_x, end_y = np.where(input_grid == end_color)

    # Draw a line connecting the start and end points
    draw_line(output_grid, start_x[0], start_y[0], end_x=end_x[0], end_y=end_y[0], color=start_color)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of random size between 10x10 and 20x20
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 21), np.random.randint(10, 21)
    grid = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)

    # Choose two distinct random colors for start and end points
    start_color, end_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), 2, replace=False)

    # Place the start point randomly on the grid
    start_x, start_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    grid[start_x, start_y] = start_color

    # Place the end point randomly on the grid, ensuring it's not the same as the start point
    end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    while end_x == start_x and end_y == start_y:
        end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    grid[end_x, end_y] = end_color

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **Concepts**: The puzzle involves drawing a straight line between two distinct points marked by unique colors on a grid. This involves understanding pixel connectivity and how to update the grid accordingly.

2. **Description**: The input grid contains two pixels, each marked with a unique color (not black), representing the start and end points. The output grid should have a straight line connecting these two points with the same color as the start point.

3. **`main` Function**: 
   - It first copies the input grid to the output grid.
   - Finds the unique colors in the grid to determine start and end points.
   - Retrieves the coordinates of the start and end points.
   - Uses the `draw_line` function from the `common.py` library to draw a line between the start and end points on the output grid.

4. **`generate_input` Function**: 
   - Generates a grid of random size with dimensions between 10x10 and 20x20.
   - Selects two distinct colors for the start and end points.
   - Randomly places these points on the grid, ensuring they are not in the same position.
