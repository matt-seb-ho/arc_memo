Here's an implementation of the puzzle as described:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# orientation detection, shape normalization, centroid-to-tip vector, direction quantization

# description:
# The input is a grid containing a single pointer-shaped object on a background. Normalize the pointer by rotating and/or flipping it to match a canonical orientation.
# Determine the pointer's facing direction by computing the vector from its centroid to its tip and quantizing this vector to one of the cardinal directions (N, S, E, W).
# Output the determined direction as a label.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find the object in the input grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)
    assert len(objects) == 1, "There should be exactly one object in the grid."
    
    pointer = objects[0]

    # Determine the bounding box of the pointer
    x, y, w, h = bounding_box(pointer, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Crop the pointer to extract the sprite
    sprite = crop(pointer, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Calculate the centroid of the pointer
    colored_pixels = np.argwhere(sprite != Color.BLACK)
    centroid = np.mean(colored_pixels, axis=0)

    # Assume the tip of the pointer is the furthest point from the centroid
    distances = np.linalg.norm(colored_pixels - centroid, axis=1)
    tip_index = np.argmax(distances)
    tip = colored_pixels[tip_index]

    # Calculate the vector from the centroid to the tip
    vector = tip - centroid

    # Quantize the vector to determine the facing direction
    # Cardinal directions: N, S, E, W
    angle = np.arctan2(vector[0], vector[1])
    if -np.pi / 4 <= angle < np.pi / 4:
        direction = 'E'  # East
    elif np.pi / 4 <= angle < 3 * np.pi / 4:
        direction = 'N'  # North
    elif -3 * np.pi / 4 <= angle < -np.pi / 4:
        direction = 'S'  # South
    else:
        direction = 'W'  # West

    return direction

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with a single pointer-shaped object
    grid_size = 20
    grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), Color.BLACK)

    # Randomly choose the pointer size and shape
    pointer_length = np.random.randint(3, 7)
    pointer_width = np.random.randint(1, 3)
    
    # Randomly choose a direction for the pointer
    direction = np.random.choice(['N', 'S', 'E', 'W'])
    
    # Create the pointer sprite
    pointer_sprite = np.full((pointer_length, pointer_width), np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK))

    if direction == 'N':
        pointer_sprite[-1, :] = Color.BLACK
    elif direction == 'S':
        pointer_sprite[0, :] = Color.BLACK
    elif direction == 'E':
        pointer_sprite[:, 0] = Color.BLACK
    elif direction == 'W':
        pointer_sprite[:, -1] = Color.BLACK

    # Find a random free location to place the pointer sprite on the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, pointer_sprite, border_size=2)
    blit_sprite(grid, pointer_sprite, x, y)

    return grid
```

In this puzzle, the `main` function detects the orientation of a pointer-shaped object on a grid by calculating the vector from its centroid to its tip and quantizing that vector to one of the cardinal directions. The `generate_input` function stochastically generates a grid with a pointer object in a random orientation, providing a variety of test cases for middle-schoolers to uncover the deterministic transformation rule.
