Certainly! Let's implement the puzzle as described, focusing on the concepts of sliding window, color presence, pattern matching, and window selection.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# sliding window, color presence, pattern matching, window selection

# description:
# Input is a grid with various colors. Slide a 3x3 window over the grid. Identify the first window that contains at least one cell of every color specified in a given set of required colors. Output the coordinates of this window. The task is to locate a heterogeneous anchor window based on color presence criteria.

def main(input_grid: np.ndarray, required_colors: Set[str]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Slide a 3x3 window over the grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    window_size = 3

    for i in range(rows - window_size + 1):
        for j in range(cols - window_size + 1):
            # Extract the 3x3 window
            window = input_grid[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]
            # Get unique colors in the window
            unique_colors_in_window = set(np.unique(window))
            # Check if all required colors are present in the window
            if required_colors.issubset(unique_colors_in_window):
                return (i, j)
    
    # If no such window is found, return a sentinel value indicating failure
    return (-1, -1)

def generate_input() -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Set[str]]:
    # Randomly generate a grid with a size between 5x5 and 10x10
    n = random.randint(5, 10)
    grid = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), (n, n))

    # Select a random subset of colors to be the required colors
    required_colors = set(random.sample(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), random.randint(2, 5)))

    # Ensure at least one valid window exists
    # Randomly choose a position to place a valid window
    valid_x = random.randint(0, n - 3)
    valid_y = random.randint(0, n - 3)
    # Place required colors in this window
    for idx, color in enumerate(required_colors):
        # Ensure each color is placed within the window
        grid[valid_x + idx % 3, valid_y + idx // 3] = color

    return grid, required_colors
```

### Explanation:

1. **`main` Function**:
   - The function slides a 3x3 window over the grid.
   - For each position of the window, it checks if all the required colors are present.
   - If a window satisfies the condition, it returns the top-left coordinates of that window.
   - If no such window is found, it returns `(-1, -1)` to indicate the absence of a valid window.

2. **`generate_input` Function**:
   - Randomly generates a grid of size between 5x5 and 10x10 filled with various colors.
   - Randomly selects a subset of colors as the required colors.
   - Ensures that at least one window in the grid contains all the required colors by manually placing these colors in a randomly chosen window. This guarantees that the puzzle always has a solution.
