Here is the implementation of the puzzle involving hole counting within a guide object using specified connectivity:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# hole counting, enclosed regions, guide object, connectivity (4/8)

# description:
# Input consists of a grid with a single guide object of a specific color, potentially enclosing regions of background color (e.g., 0).
# Count the number of enclosed regions (holes) within the guide object that are not of the guide object's color.
# Use specified connectivity (4 or 8) to determine whether regions are enclosed.
# Output is the integer count of such holes.

def main(input_grid):
    # Assume the guide object is the largest non-black connected component
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)
    guide_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))
    
    # Get the interior of the guide object
    interior_mask = object_interior(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    # Find the holes: regions within the guide object that are not of the guide object's color
    guide_color = guide_object[guide_object != Color.BLACK][0]
    hole_mask = (guide_object == Color.BLACK) & interior_mask
    
    # Find connected components in the hole mask to count the holes using the specified connectivity
    hole_objects = find_connected_components(hole_mask, background=False, connectivity=8, monochromatic=False)
    
    # Count the number of distinct holes
    num_holes = len(hole_objects)
    
    return num_holes

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with a single large guide object and random holes within it
    n = np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((n, n), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Create a guide object
    guide_size = np.random.randint(5, n-2)
    guide_object = np.full((guide_size, guide_size), Color.BLUE)
    
    # Carve out holes in the guide object
    num_holes = np.random.randint(1, 4)
    for _ in range(num_holes):
        hole_size = np.random.randint(1, guide_size // 2)
        hole = random_sprite(hole_size, hole_size, color_palette=[Color.BLACK], background=Color.BLUE)
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(guide_object, hole, padding=1, border_size=1, background=Color.BLUE)
            blit_sprite(guide_object, hole, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    # Place the guide object into the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, padding=1, border_size=1, background=Color.BLACK)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, x, y)
    
    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **Concepts and Description:**
   - The puzzle involves identifying and counting enclosed regions (holes) within a guide object using specified connectivity.
   - The `main` function identifies the guide object, finds holes within it, and counts them.

2. **`main` Function:**
   - Identifies the guide object as the largest connected component that is not the background color.
   - Calculates the interior of the guide object.
   - Identifies holes by finding regions that are not part of the guide object but enclosed within it.
   - Counts these holes using connectivity to differentiate distinct regions.

3. **`generate_input` Function:**
   - Randomly generates a grid with a guide object.
   - Randomly carves holes within the guide object.
   - Ensures the guide object is placed within the grid respecting the background.

This implementation captures the essence of hole counting within a guide object and provides an interactive puzzle for middle-schoolers to solve.
