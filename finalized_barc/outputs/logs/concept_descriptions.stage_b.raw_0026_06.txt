Sure! Let's create a puzzle based on the description provided. We'll use the functions from `common.py` for generating inputs and implementing the transformation logic. The puzzle involves segmenting a grid into regions using divider lines and extracting each region as a subgrid.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# divider lines, region extraction, array slicing

# description:
# Input is a grid potentially divided into distinct regions by horizontal or vertical lines of a specific color.
# Identify these divider lines and use them to segment the grid into separate regions.
# Each region is extracted as a subgrid, excluding the divider lines themselves.
# Output is a list of these subgrids, preserving their original content and relative order.

def main(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> List[np.ndarray]:
    # Determine the color of the divider lines by finding lines that extend fully across rows or columns
    divider_color = None
    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        if np.all(input_grid[i, :] == input_grid[i, 0]):
            divider_color = input_grid[i, 0]
            break
    if divider_color is None:
        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            if np.all(input_grid[:, j] == input_grid[0, j]):
                divider_color = input_grid[0, j]
                break

    assert divider_color is not None, "No divider color found"

    # Identify horizontal and vertical divider lines
    vertical_dividers = [x for x in range(input_grid.shape[0]) if np.all(input_grid[x, :] == divider_color)]
    horizontal_dividers = [y for y in range(input_grid.shape[1]) if np.all(input_grid[:, y] == divider_color)]

    # Add grid boundaries to the divider lists
    vertical_dividers = [-1] + vertical_dividers + [input_grid.shape[0]]
    horizontal_dividers = [-1] + horizontal_dividers + [input_grid.shape[1]]

    # Extract each region as a subgrid
    subgrids = []
    for i in range(len(vertical_dividers) - 1):
        for j in range(len(horizontal_dividers) - 1):
            x1, x2 = vertical_dividers[i] + 1, vertical_dividers[i + 1]
            y1, y2 = horizontal_dividers[j] + 1, horizontal_dividers[j + 1]
            subgrid = input_grid[x1:x2, y1:y2]
            if subgrid.size > 0:
                subgrids.append(subgrid)

    return subgrids

def generate_input() -> np.ndarray:
    # Randomly generate grid dimensions
    width, height = np.random.randint(15, 30), np.random.randint(15, 30)
    grid = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), (width, height), replace=True)

    # Select a random color for divider lines
    divider_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))

    # Randomly choose number of dividers and their positions
    num_vertical_dividers = np.random.randint(1, 4)
    num_horizontal_dividers = np.random.randint(1, 4)
    vertical_positions = randomly_spaced_indices(max_len=width, n_indices=num_vertical_dividers, border_size=1, padding=2)
    horizontal_positions = randomly_spaced_indices(max_len=height, n_indices=num_horizontal_dividers, border_size=1, padding=2)

    # Draw the divider lines on the grid
    for x in vertical_positions:
        grid[x, :] = divider_color
    for y in horizontal_positions:
        grid[:, y] = divider_color

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

- **`main` Function**: 
  - First, it detects the divider color by scanning for lines that extend fully across rows or columns.
  - It identifies vertical and horizontal dividers by checking for complete lines of the divider color.
  - It then extracts regions between these dividers as subgrids, ensuring not to include the divider lines themselves.

- **`generate_input` Function**:
  - It generates a grid of random dimensions filled with random colors.
  - It selects a random color for the divider lines.
  - It uses functions to randomly place vertical and horizontal dividers, ensuring adequate space between dividers.
  - The grid is then returned as the input for the puzzle.

This setup creates a fun and educational puzzle where students can understand and implement region extraction from a grid with dividers, using Python's array slicing capabilities.
