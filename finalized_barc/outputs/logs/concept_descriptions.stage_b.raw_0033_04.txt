Here's the implementation of the puzzle based on the given description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# orientation detection, recolor, connected components, bounding box

# description:
# The input consists of a grid containing a single connected object of any shape and color except black. 
# The task is to determine the object's orientation by finding which corner of its bounding box is missing. 
# Once the missing corner is identified (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), recolor the entire object using the following mapping:
# top-left -> red (3), top-right -> yellow (4), bottom-left -> green (2), and bottom-right -> blue (1).
# The background (black) and any other grid content remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Extract the connected components of the grid
    components = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)

    # There should only be one connected component, which is the object
    obj = components[0]

    # Find the bounding box of the object
    x, y, width, height = bounding_box(obj, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Determine the missing corner based on the objectâ€™s position in the bounding box
    if not np.any(obj[x:x+1, y:y+1] != Color.BLACK):
        # Top-left corner is missing
        fill_color = Color.RED
    elif not np.any(obj[x:x+1, y+width-1:y+width] != Color.BLACK):
        # Top-right corner is missing
        fill_color = Color.YELLOW
    elif not np.any(obj[x+height-1:x+height, y:y+1] != Color.BLACK):
        # Bottom-left corner is missing
        fill_color = Color.GREEN
    elif not np.any(obj[x+height-1:x+height, y+width-1:y+width] != Color.BLACK):
        # Bottom-right corner is missing
        fill_color = Color.BLUE

    # Recolor the object uniformly with the determined color
    flood_fill(input_grid, x, y, fill_color, connectivity=8)

    return input_grid


def generate_input():
    # Create a random grid size
    grid_size = np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a random sprite and place it at a random location
    sprite_size = np.random.randint(4, 6)
    sprite = random_sprite(sprite_size, sprite_size, color_palette=[random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))], connectivity=8)
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1, padding_connectivity=8)

    # Place the sprite onto the grid
    blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Remove one corner from the bounding box of the sprite
    if np.random.rand() < 0.25:
        # Remove top-left corner
        grid[x, y] = Color.BLACK
    elif np.random.rand() < 0.5:
        # Remove top-right corner
        grid[x, y + sprite_size - 1] = Color.BLACK
    elif np.random.rand() < 0.75:
        # Remove bottom-left corner
        grid[x + sprite_size - 1, y] = Color.BLACK
    else:
        # Remove bottom-right corner
        grid[x + sprite_size - 1, y + sprite_size - 1] = Color.BLACK

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

- **Concepts**: The puzzle involves understanding orientation detection by identifying the missing corner of an object's bounding box and then applying a deterministic recoloring transformation based on this orientation.

- **Main Function**: This function first detects the connected components of the grid to isolate the object, then uses the bounding box to determine which corner is missing. The object's color is then updated according to the orientation mapping.

- **Generate Input Function**: This function creates a grid with a single object and randomly removes one corner of its bounding box. It ensures a variety of inputs with different shapes and orientations, making the puzzle interesting and challenging for middle-schoolers.
