Here is an implementation for the puzzle described, focusing on identifying a guide object based on unique color among connected components in a grid.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# unique color selection, connected components, object identification, guide object

# description:
# In the input grid, you will see various objects, each with a specific color.
# The task is to identify the object whose color is unique among all objects in the grid.
# The output grid should highlight or isolate the guide object based on its unique color,
# while all other objects remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all connected components, assuming each component is monochromatic
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, monochromatic=True, connectivity=4)

    # Dictionary to count the frequency of each color
    color_count = {}

    for obj in objects:
        # Since objects are monochromatic, any non-black pixel will give the color of the object
        color = np.unique(obj[obj != Color.BLACK])[0]
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1

    # Find the unique color (appears only once among the objects)
    unique_color = None
    for color, count in color_count.items():
        if count == 1:
            unique_color = color
            break

    if unique_color is None:
        raise ValueError("No unique colored object found.")

    # Create the output grid
    output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, Color.BLACK)

    # Isolate the object with the unique color
    for obj in objects:
        if np.any(obj == unique_color):
            blit_object(output_grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid of size n x n
    n = np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((n, n), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a set of colors to use, ensuring one unique color
    available_colors = list(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    unique_color = np.random.choice(available_colors)
    colors = [unique_color] + [np.random.choice(available_colors) for _ in range(np.random.randint(3, 6))]

    for color in colors:
        # Create a random object with the chosen color
        sprite = random_sprite(n=np.random.randint(2, 4), m=np.random.randint(2, 4), color_palette=[color], density=np.random.uniform(0.3, 0.7))
        
        # Try to place the object on the grid
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1, border_size=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            # If there is no space, skip placing this object
            continue

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

- **`main` function**: 
  - Identifies connected components in the grid.
  - Counts the occurrence of each color among the components.
  - Identifies the unique color and isolates the corresponding object in the output grid.

- **`generate_input` function**: 
  - Creates a grid and fills it with randomly generated objects of different colors, ensuring one color is unique.
  - Uses provided library functions to guarantee non-overlapping placement of objects within the grid.

This design leverages functions from `common.py` to detect and manipulate the grid's connected components and colors, ensuring the transformation is both effective and deterministic.
