Here's an implementation of the puzzle based on the description you provided. This puzzle involves creating a boolean mask by evaluating a predicate on each cell in a grid region. The resulting mask serves as a template for identifying the pattern in other grid regions.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# boolean mask, predicate evaluation, pattern recognition, template creation

# description:
# The input is a grid region (block) and a predicate function. The task is to evaluate the predicate at each cell in the block 
# to produce a boolean mask, where each mask cell is True if the predicate is satisfied at that location, otherwise False. 
# This mask serves as a reusable template for identifying the pattern in other grid regions.

def main(input_grid):
    # Define a sample predicate function: Check if the color is not black
    def predicate(color):
        return color != Color.BLACK

    # Create a boolean mask by evaluating the predicate at each grid cell
    mask = np.array([
        [predicate(input_grid[x, y]) for y in range(input_grid.shape[1])]
        for x in range(input_grid.shape[0])
    ])

    return mask

def generate_input():
    # Randomly generate a grid size
    width, height = np.random.randint(5, 10), np.random.randint(5, 10)
    grid = np.full((width, height), Color.BLACK)

    # Randomly scatter colors across the grid
    for color in np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), size=np.random.randint(3, 6), replace=False):
        randomly_scatter_points(grid, color=color, density=0.3)

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

- **`main` function**: 
  - Defines a predicate function that evaluates whether the color of a grid cell is not black.
  - Constructs a boolean mask by applying this predicate to each cell in the input grid. The mask will have `True` where the predicate is satisfied (i.e., the cell is not black) and `False` otherwise.

- **`generate_input` function**:
  - Creates a grid of random size filled initially with black.
  - Randomly scatters a selection of colors across the grid to ensure there are colored cells to evaluate with the predicate.

This puzzle challenges middle-schoolers to understand how predicates (logical conditions) can be applied across a grid to produce a meaningful pattern or template that can be reused or analyzed further.
