# description:
# The input grid is a 2D array where certain rows or columns are entirely filled with a specific color, acting as dividers.
# These dividers segment the grid into separate regions. The task is to identify these divider lines, 
# segment the grid into distinct subgrids, and return these subgrids as a list, excluding the dividers themselves.

def main(input_grid):
    # Plan:
    # 1. Identify horizontal and vertical divider lines
    # 2. Use these lines to segment the grid into separate regions
    # 3. Extract and return these regions as subgrids, excluding the dividers

    width, height = input_grid.shape
    # Assume the divider color is the most frequent color in the grid
    unique, counts = np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True)
    divider_color = unique[np.argmax(counts)]

    # Identify horizontal and vertical divider lines
    horizontal_dividers = [y for y in range(height) if np.all(input_grid[:, y] == divider_color)]
    vertical_dividers = [x for x in range(width) if np.all(input_grid[x, :] == divider_color)]

    # Add grid boundaries as implied dividers
    horizontal_dividers = [0] + horizontal_dividers + [height]
    vertical_dividers = [0] + vertical_dividers + [width]

    # Extract subgrids
    subgrids = []
    for i in range(len(vertical_dividers) - 1):
        for j in range(len(horizontal_dividers) - 1):
            x1, x2 = vertical_dividers[i] + 1, vertical_dividers[i + 1]
            y1, y2 = horizontal_dividers[j] + 1, horizontal_dividers[j + 1]
            subgrid = input_grid[x1:x2, y1:y2]
            subgrids.append(subgrid)

    return subgrids

def generate_input():
    # Randomly generate the grid size
    width, height = np.random.randint(10, 20), np.random.randint(10, 20)
    grid = np.random.choice(Color.ALL_COLORS, (width, height), replace=True)

    # Choose a random color for the divider
    divider_color = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)

    # Randomly determine the number of dividers
    num_horizontal_dividers = np.random.randint(1, 4)
    num_vertical_dividers = np.random.randint(1, 4)

    # Generate divider lines
    horizontal_divider_indices = randomly_spaced_indices(height, num_horizontal_dividers, border_size=1, padding=1)
    vertical_divider_indices = randomly_spaced_indices(width, num_vertical_dividers, border_size=1, padding=1)

    # Apply divider lines to the grid
    for y in horizontal_divider_indices:
        grid[:, y] = divider_color

    for x in vertical_divider_indices:
        grid[x, :] = divider_color

    return grid
```

In this puzzle, the input grid is divided into regions by lines of a specific divider color. The task is to extract these regions as separate subgrids, excluding the dividers themselves. The `generate_input` function creates random grids with divider lines, while the `main` function processes these grids to identify and extract the regions.
