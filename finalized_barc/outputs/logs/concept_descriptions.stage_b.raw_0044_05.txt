To implement the new puzzle based on the provided description, we'll create a system where a specific 3x3 window is processed according to a given predicate function. The cells within the window will be checked against this predicate, and those that do not satisfy it will be filled with a specified fill value. This requires understanding grid manipulation and applying conditional logic to manipulate the grid.

Here's how we can implement this puzzle:

```python
from common import *
import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# window processing, predicate check, conditional fill, grid manipulation

# description:
# The input is a grid with specific 3x3 window coordinates and a predicate function.
# For each cell within the specified 3x3 window, check if it satisfies the predicate.
# If a cell does not satisfy the predicate, replace its value with a specified fill_value.
# Cells that satisfy the predicate remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid, window_coords, predicate, fill_value):
    # Extract the 3x3 window based on the provided coordinates
    x_start, y_start = window_coords
    x_end, y_end = x_start + 3, y_start + 3
    
    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Process each cell within the 3x3 window
    for x in range(x_start, x_end):
        for y in range(y_start, y_end):
            # Check if the cell satisfies the predicate
            if not predicate(input_grid[x, y]):
                # If not, replace its value with the fill_value
                output_grid[x, y] = fill_value
    
    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Define the grid size
    grid_size = np.random.randint(5, 10)
    grid = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK, size=(grid_size, grid_size))
    
    # Randomly pick a 3x3 window within the grid
    x_start = np.random.randint(0, grid_size - 2)
    y_start = np.random.randint(0, grid_size - 2)
    window_coords = (x_start, y_start)
    
    # Define the predicate function (example: check if the color is in a specific subset)
    colors_subset = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK, size=3, replace=False)
    predicate = lambda color: color in colors_subset
    
    # Define the fill value (a random color not in the subset)
    fill_value = np.random.choice([color for color in Color.NOT_BLACK if color not in colors_subset])
    
    return grid, window_coords, predicate, fill_value

# Example usage:
# input_grid, window_coords, predicate, fill_value = generate_input()
# transformed_grid = main(input_grid, window_coords, predicate, fill_value)
```

### Explanation:
- **`main` function**: This function processes a specific 3x3 region within the grid determined by `window_coords`. Each cell in this window is checked against a predicate function. If a cell does not satisfy the predicate, it is replaced with a `fill_value`. The function returns the modified grid.
  
- **`generate_input` function**: This function generates a random grid and defines a random 3x3 window within it. It also generates a random predicate function that checks if a color belongs to a randomly chosen subset of colors. A `fill_value` is chosen as a color not in the subset. The function returns the grid, window coordinates, predicate, and fill value for use in `main`.

This puzzle challenges students to understand grid manipulation, apply conditional logic, and work with randomization in grid-based puzzles.
