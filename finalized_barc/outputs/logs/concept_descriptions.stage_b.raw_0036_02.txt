Certainly! Here's an implementation of the described puzzle, which involves drawing a straight line between two marked points on a grid using Bresenham's line algorithm:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# line drawing, pixel connectivity, grid update

# description:
# The input grid contains two distinct pixels marked as start and end.
# The task is to draw a straight line connecting these two pixels using Bresenham's line algorithm.
# The pixels along this path should be updated to a specified line color, while all other pixels remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find the start and end points
    start_color = Color.BLUE
    end_color = Color.RED
    line_color = Color.GREEN

    # Locate the start and end pixel positions
    start_pos = np.argwhere(input_grid == start_color)[0]
    end_pos = np.argwhere(input_grid == end_color)[0]

    # Initialize the output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Bresenham's line algorithm to draw a line
    x1, y1 = start_pos
    x2, y2 = end_pos
    dx = abs(x2 - x1)
    dy = abs(y2 - y1)
    sx = 1 if x1 < x2 else -1
    sy = 1 if y1 < y2 else -1
    err = dx - dy

    while True:
        output_grid[x1, y1] = line_color
        if x1 == x2 and y1 == y2:
            break
        e2 = 2 * err
        if e2 > -dy:
            err -= dy
            x1 += sx
        if e2 < dx:
            err += dx
            y1 += sy

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with random dimensions between 10x10 and 20x20
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 20, size=2)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Randomly select two distinct positions for the start and end points
    start_x, start_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    while start_x == end_x and start_y == end_y:
        end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)

    # Assign start and end colors
    grid[start_x, start_y] = Color.BLUE
    grid[end_x, end_y] = Color.RED

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
- **Concepts**: The puzzle involves line drawing, pixel connectivity, and updating a grid based on a deterministic procedure.
- **Description**: The input grid contains two distinct points, marked with different colors. The goal is to draw a straight line connecting these two points using Bresenham's line algorithm. This algorithm is efficient for rasterizing lines on a grid.
- **Main Function**: The `main` function finds the start and end points, then draws a line between them using Bresenham's algorithm, coloring the path with a specified line color.
- **Generate Input Function**: This function creates a grid and randomly places two distinct points on it, ensuring they are not the same. The grid size and placement are stochastic, giving different valid inputs each time.
