Here is the implementation of the puzzle based on the provided description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# diagonal movement, zigzag pattern, axis-aligned runs, boundary detection

# description:
# In the input, you will see a grid with a single seed pixel.
# To make the output, starting from this seed pixel, create a diagonal zigzag pattern by alternating between horizontal and vertical movements.
# Move horizontally by a fixed number of pixels (horizontal_step), then vertically by another fixed number (vertical_step), painting each traversed pixel.
# Continue this pattern until the grid boundary is reached. The result is a staircase-like diagonal composed of axis-aligned segments.

def main(input_grid):
    # Output grid is the same size as the input grid
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Detect the seed pixel
    pixel = find_connected_components(input_grid, monochromatic=True)[0]
    pixel_color = object_colors(pixel)[0]
    pixel_x, pixel_y = object_position(pixel)

    # Define horizontal and vertical step sizes
    horizontal_step = 3
    vertical_step = 2

    # Start from the seed pixel
    x, y = pixel_x, pixel_y

    # Create the zigzag pattern
    while True:
        # Move horizontally
        for _ in range(horizontal_step):
            if x >= output_grid.shape[0]:
                return output_grid
            output_grid[x, y] = pixel_color
            x += 1

        # Move vertically
        for _ in range(vertical_step):
            if y >= output_grid.shape[1]:
                return output_grid
            output_grid[x - 1, y] = pixel_color
            y += 1

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid with random dimensions
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 20, size=2)
    grid = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)

    # Randomly choose the color of the seed pixel
    seed_pixel_color = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)

    # Randomly place the seed pixel within the grid
    x = np.random.randint(0, n // 2)  # Place seed pixel in the left half
    y = np.random.randint(0, m // 2)  # Place seed pixel in the top half
    grid[x, y] = seed_pixel_color

    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Concepts and Description:**
   - The puzzle involves creating a diagonal zigzag pattern starting from a seed pixel.
   - The pattern alternates between horizontal and vertical movements until it reaches the grid boundary.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Determines the position of the seed pixel and its color.
   - Implements a loop to alternate between horizontal and vertical movements, creating a zigzag pattern.
   - Stops when the boundary of the grid is reached.

3. **Generate Input Function:**
   - Creates a grid with random dimensions.
   - Places a single seed pixel randomly in the left and top half of the grid to ensure space for zigzag pattern generation.
   - Randomly assigns a color to the seed pixel.
