Let's implement the puzzle based on the provided description. The puzzle involves scanning a grid and checking for specific patterns (2x2 windows with all cells matching a target color). We will implement two functions: `main` for the transformation and `generate_input` for generating stochastic input grids.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
import random
from typing import *

# concepts:
# window scanning, color matching, pattern detection

# description:
# Input is a grid with various colors. For each 2x2 window in the grid, check if all cells match a specified target color.
# Return a grid of the same size where each 2x2 window is True if every cell matches the target color, otherwise False.

def main(input_grid: np.ndarray, target_color: str) -> np.ndarray:
    # Create a boolean output grid of the same size as input grid
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid, dtype=bool)
    
    # Define the dimensions of the grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each 2x2 window
    for i in range(rows - 1):
        for j in range(cols - 1):
            # Extract the 2x2 window
            window = input_grid[i:i+2, j:j+2]
            
            # Check if all elements in the window match the target color
            if np.all(window == target_color):
                # Mark the top-left corner of the 2x2 window as True
                output_grid[i, j] = True
    
    return output_grid

def generate_input() -> Tuple[np.ndarray, str]:
    # Randomly choose the grid dimensions between 5x5 and 10x10
    n, m = random.randint(5, 10), random.randint(5, 10)

    # Create an empty grid
    grid = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)

    # Randomly select a target color from the available colors (excluding black)
    target_color = random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)

    # Fill the grid with random colors
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            grid[i, j] = random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)

    return grid, target_color
```

### Explanation:
- **Main Function**:
  - Iterates through each possible 2x2 window in the grid.
  - Checks if all elements in the window are the same as the `target_color`.
  - Marks the top-left corner of the window in the `output_grid` as `True` if the condition is met.

- **Generate Input Function**:
  - Generates a grid of random dimensions between 5x5 and 10x10.
  - Fills the grid with random colors from the available color set.
  - Randomly selects a target color, ensuring it's not black, to check against in the `main` function.

This puzzle challenges students to understand pattern detection within a 2D grid using window scanning techniques.
