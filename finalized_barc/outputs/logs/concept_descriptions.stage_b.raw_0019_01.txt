Sure, let's create a puzzle based on the description you provided:

**Concepts**: Unique color identification, guide object selection, connected components

**Description**: 
The input consists of multiple distinct objects on a grid, each with a unique color. Identify the guide object as the one whose color is not shared by any other object in the grid. The output is a transformation where the guide object is selected based on its unique color, while all other objects remain unchanged.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# unique color identification, guide object selection, connected components

# description:
# The input consists of multiple distinct objects on a grid, each with a unique color. Identify the guide object as the
# one whose color is not shared by any other object in the grid. The output is a transformation where the guide object
# is selected based on its unique color, while all other objects remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Step 1: Extract all objects from the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)

    # Step 2: Determine the color of each object
    color_to_object = {}
    for obj in objects:
        obj_colors = object_colors(obj, background=Color.BLACK)
        # Since the objects are monochromatic, we take the first color
        color = obj_colors[0]
        if color in color_to_object:
            color_to_object[color].append(obj)
        else:
            color_to_object[color] = [obj]

    # Step 3: Identify the guide object with a unique color
    guide_object = None
    for color, objs in color_to_object.items():
        if len(objs) == 1:  # Unique color
            guide_object = objs[0]
            break

    # Step 4: Create the output grid
    output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, Color.BLACK)

    # Step 5: Place the guide object on the output grid
    if guide_object is not None:
        blit_object(output_grid, guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a random grid size
    width, height = np.random.randint(10, 15), np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((width, height), Color.BLACK)

    # Define possible colors excluding black
    colors = list(Color.NOT_BLACK)

    # Generate random objects with unique colors
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 7)
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        # Randomly select a color for the object
        object_color = colors.pop(np.random.randint(0, len(colors)))

        # Generate a random sprite for the object
        sprite = random_sprite(n=[2, 3, 4], m=[2, 3, 4], color_palette=[object_color])

        # Place the sprite on the grid at a random free location
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
        except ValueError:
            # If no free location is found, skip this object
            continue

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **Main Function**:
   - **Extract Objects**: We use `find_connected_components` to identify each distinct object in the grid.
   - **Identify Unique-colored Object**: By creating a dictionary `color_to_object`, we can determine which color is associated with only one object, identifying our guide object.
   - **Output Grid**: We create an output grid and place only the guide object using `blit_object`.

2. **Generate Input**:
   - **Grid Size**: Randomly choose a grid size between 10x10 and 15x15.
   - **Object Generation**: Using `random_sprite`, create objects with unique colors and place them on the grid without overlap.
   - **Unique Colors**: Ensure each object has a unique color by maintaining a list of available colors.

This puzzle challenges students to understand how to identify unique elements based on properties within a dataset, a key concept in both programming and problem-solving.
