Here is an implementation of the new puzzle that involves identifying a guide object and using its position for a transformation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, starting point, position-based transformation

# description:
# In the input, you will see a grid with various colored objects. One of these objects is distinct in color and acts as a guide.
# The transformation is to rotate all other objects around the guide object's center by 90 degrees clockwise.
# The guide object does not change its position or orientation.

def main(input_grid):
    # Step 1: Detect all objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=4, monochromatic=True)

    # Step 2: Identify the guide object by its unique color
    guide_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: max(np.sum(obj == color) for color in Color.NOT_BLACK))
    guide_color = next(color for color in Color.NOT_BLACK if np.any(guide_object == color))

    # Step 3: Identify the position of the guide object
    guide_x, guide_y, _, _ = bounding_box(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Step 4: Create output grid and perform transformation on other objects
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    for obj in objects:
        if np.any(obj == guide_color):
            # Skip the guide object itself
            continue

        # Rotate the object 90 degrees clockwise around the guide's center
        obj_sprite = crop(obj, background=Color.BLACK)
        rotated_sprite = np.rot90(obj_sprite, k=-1)

        # Find the center of the original object
        obj_x, obj_y, obj_w, obj_h = bounding_box(obj, background=Color.BLACK)
        obj_center_x, obj_center_y = obj_x + obj_w // 2, obj_y + obj_h // 2

        # Calculate new position after rotation
        new_x = guide_x + (obj_center_y - guide_y)
        new_y = guide_y - (obj_center_x - guide_x)

        # Blit the rotated object into the output grid
        blit_sprite(output_grid, rotated_sprite, x=new_x - rotated_sprite.shape[0] // 2, y=new_y - rotated_sprite.shape[1] // 2)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of random size
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 15), np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a random guide object with a unique color
    guide_color = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    guide_sprite = random_sprite(3, 3, color_palette=[guide_color])
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_sprite, x, y)

    # Generate other objects with random colors and place them on the grid
    for _ in range(np.random.randint(3, 6)):
        obj_color = np.random.choice([c for c in Color.NOT_BLACK if c != guide_color])
        obj_sprite = random_sprite(np.random.randint(2, 4), np.random.randint(2, 4), color_palette=[obj_color])
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, obj_sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, obj_sprite, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            continue

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

- **Concepts**: This puzzle focuses on identifying a guide object and using its position to rotate other objects around it.
- **Description**: The input consists of a grid with various colored objects, one of which acts as a guide due to its distinct color. The task is to rotate all other objects around the guide by 90 degrees clockwise, without changing the guide object's position or orientation.
- **`main` Function**: Detects and identifies the guide object, calculates the necessary transformations for the other objects, and applies the rotations.
- **`generate_input` Function**: Generates a grid with a distinct guide object and several other objects, ensuring the guide is uniquely identifiable by its color.
