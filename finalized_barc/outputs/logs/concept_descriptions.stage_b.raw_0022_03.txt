Here's a new puzzle implementation based on the provided description:

# concepts:
# pattern extrapolation, sequence prediction, feature analysis, progression detection

# description:
# Input consists of a sequence of grids representing consecutive time steps, where objects exhibit a consistent transformation pattern in terms of position, size, or color. 
# Analyze the sequence to identify the evolving pattern, such as linear movement, size change, or color shift. 
# Extrapolate the identified pattern to predict and generate the next grid in the sequence. 
# The output is a single grid that continues the detected pattern logically from the last input grid.

This puzzle involves analyzing a sequence of grids to identify patterns in object transformations, such as movement and size change, and then extrapolating these patterns to predict the next grid state. The `main` function is deterministic and predicts the next grid based on the identified pattern, while `generate_input` creates a random sequence of input grids that follow a consistent transformation pattern.
