Let's implement a puzzle based on the provided description. We'll focus on identifying a single connected component in a grid and applying a given color scheme to it. The color scheme can be a single color or based on some property of the object.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# recolor, connected components, color scheme

# description:
# In the input grid, you have various colored objects. One of these objects will be selected based on its size (area).
# The largest object in the grid will be recolored entirely with a new color, say BLUE.
# The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all connected components in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=4, monochromatic=True)
    
    # Determine the largest object based on the number of non-background pixels
    largest_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))
    
    # Create a copy of the input grid for the output
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    
    # Recolor the largest object to BLUE
    largest_object[largest_object != Color.BLACK] = Color.BLUE
    
    # Blit the recolored largest object back into the output grid
    blit_object(output_grid, largest_object, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Define grid size
    n = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    grid = np.full((n, n), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Generate a variety of random objects with different colors
    num_objects = np.random.randint(4, 8)
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        obj_size = np.random.randint(3, 7)
        obj_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
        obj = random_sprite(obj_size, obj_size, color_palette=[obj_color])
        
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, obj, padding=1, padding_connectivity=8)
            blit_sprite(grid, obj, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
        except ValueError:
            # If we can't place anymore objects, return the grid
            return grid
    
    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **Concepts**:
   - **Recolor**: The main task is to recolor the largest connected component.
   - **Connected Components**: The puzzle involves identifying connected components in the grid.
   - **Color Scheme**: Applying a specific color scheme (in this case, recoloring the largest object to BLUE).

2. **Description**:
   - The input grid contains various colored objects.
   - The goal is to identify the largest connected component (object) based on the area (number of non-background pixels).
   - Once identified, the largest object is recolored to BLUE, while other elements in the grid remain unchanged.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The `main` function uses `find_connected_components` to identify all objects and then selects the largest one.
   - The largest object is recolored using `Color.BLUE`.
   - The `generate_input` function generates a grid with a random size and populates it with random objects of various colors. This ensures variability in the input grid.
