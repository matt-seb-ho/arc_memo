To implement the puzzle, we will focus on determining the orientation of a connected object based on its bounding box and recolor it according to the specified color map. Let's proceed with the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# orientation detection, recolor, connected components, bounding box

# description:
# Input is a single connected object on a grid. Determine the object's orientation by identifying the missing corner in its bounding box (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Recolor the entire object uniformly based on this orientation using a fixed color map: top-left to red (3), top-right to yellow (4), bottom-left to green (2), and bottom-right to blue (1). The background and any other grid content remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find the connected components
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, monochromatic=True, connectivity=4)
    
    # We expect exactly one connected object in the grid
    assert len(objects) == 1, "There should be exactly one connected object in the grid."
    
    # Extract the object
    obj = objects[0]
    
    # Determine the bounding box of the object
    x, y, width, height = bounding_box(obj)
    
    # Define the corners of the bounding box
    corners = {
        'top-left': (x, y),
        'top-right': (x + width - 1, y),
        'bottom-left': (x, y + height - 1),
        'bottom-right': (x + width - 1, y + height - 1)
    }
    
    # Check which corner is missing
    missing_corner = None
    for corner_name, (cx, cy) in corners.items():
        if obj[cy, cx] == Color.BLACK:  # Assuming background is black
            missing_corner = corner_name
            break
    
    # Define the color map based on the missing corner
    color_map = {
        'top-left': Color.RED,
        'top-right': Color.YELLOW,
        'bottom-left': Color.GREEN,
        'bottom-right': Color.BLUE
    }
    
    # Determine the color to fill the object
    fill_color = color_map[missing_corner]
    
    # Recolor the connected object
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    flood_fill(output_grid, y, x, fill_color, connectivity=4)
    
    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with single connected object
    n, m = np.random.randint(5, 10), np.random.randint(5, 10)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Generate a random monochromatic sprite
    sprite = random_sprite(n, m, density=0.5, connectivity=4, color_palette=[Color.GREY])
    
    # Determine a position to blit the sprite into the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, background=Color.BLACK)
    blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)
    
    # Remove a corner from the sprite's bounding box
    sx, sy, sw, sh = bounding_box(sprite)
    corner_to_remove = np.random.choice(['top-left', 'top-right', 'bottom-left', 'bottom-right'])
    if corner_to_remove == 'top-left':
        sprite[sy, sx] = Color.BLACK
    elif corner_to_remove == 'top-right':
        sprite[sy, sx + sw - 1] = Color.BLACK
    elif corner_to_remove == 'bottom-left':
        sprite[sy + sh - 1, sx] = Color.BLACK
    elif corner_to_remove == 'bottom-right':
        sprite[sy + sh - 1, sx + sw - 1] = Color.BLACK
    
    # Blit the modified sprite back into the grid
    blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)
    
    return grid
```

This puzzle involves detecting the orientation of an object by identifying the missing corner in its bounding box and then recoloring the object according to a predefined color map. The `generate_input` function creates a random grid with a single connected object, ensuring a corner is removed to provide a clear orientation.
