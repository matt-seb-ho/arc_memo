Here is the implementation for the puzzle involving L-shape detection on a 2x2 grid. This puzzle requires identifying which corner is unoccupied by the L-shape, and then outputting the orientation based on the missing corner.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# L-shape detection, corner identification, orientation classification

# description:
# Input is a 3-pixel L-shaped triomino on a 2x2 grid. Identify which of the four corners
# (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) is unoccupied by the L-shape. Output the
# orientation as one of "tl", "tr", "bl", or "br" corresponding to the missing corner.
# The grid may contain noise, but the L-shape is dominant.

def main(input_grid):
    # Identify the location of the non-background pixels
    non_background_coords = np.argwhere(input_grid != Color.BLACK)
    
    # Determine which corner is missing by checking the coordinates
    corners = {
        "tl": (0, 0),
        "tr": (0, 1),
        "bl": (1, 0),
        "br": (1, 1)
    }
    
    # Find the missing corner by checking which one is not part of the non-background coordinates
    for corner, coord in corners.items():
        if tuple(coord) not in map(tuple, non_background_coords):
            missing_corner = corner
            break
    
    # Create the output grid with the orientation text
    output_grid = np.array([[missing_corner]], dtype=object)
    
    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a 2x2 grid filled with the background color
    grid = np.full((2, 2), Color.BLACK, dtype=int)

    # Randomly select one of the four possible L-shape orientations
    orientations = {
        "tl": [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)],
        "tr": [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)],
        "bl": [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)],
        "br": [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]
    }
    chosen_orientation = np.random.choice(list(orientations.keys()))

    # Fill in the L-shape on the grid with a random color from the palette
    color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    for coord in orientations[chosen_orientation]:
        grid[coord[0], coord[1]] = color

    # Optionally add some noise on the grid, but ensure L-shape is dominant
    noise_density = np.random.uniform(0, 0.1)  # Small chance of noise
    if np.random.rand() < noise_density:
        noise_coords = np.random.choice(4, size=int(noise_density * 4), replace=False)
        for coord in noise_coords:
            x, y = divmod(coord, 2)
            if grid[x, y] == Color.BLACK:  # Only add noise to empty spaces
                grid[x, y] = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))

    return grid
```

This implementation creates a 2x2 grid with an L-shaped triomino and detects which corner is missing, creating an output with the appropriate orientation label. The `generate_input` function ensures randomness by choosing an orientation and optionally adding noise to the grid.
