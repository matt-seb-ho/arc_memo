Here's a code block that implements the puzzle described, following the format of the examples you provided:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# orientation detection, shape normalization, centroid-to-tip vector, direction quantization

# description:
# The input is a grid containing a single pointer-shaped object on a background. 
# The goal is to normalize the pointer by rotating and/or flipping it to match a canonical orientation. 
# Then, determine the pointer's facing direction by computing the vector from its centroid to its tip and quantizing this vector to one of the cardinal directions (N, S, E, W). 
# Output the determined direction as a label.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find the object in the input grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)
    
    # Assuming there is exactly one pointer object
    pointer = objects[0]

    # Determine the bounding box and crop the object
    x, y, w, h = bounding_box(pointer)
    cropped_pointer = crop(pointer)

    # Compute the centroid of the pointer
    centroid = np.mean(np.argwhere(cropped_pointer != Color.BLACK), axis=0)

    # Determine the tip of the pointer (farthest point from the centroid)
    tip = max(np.argwhere(cropped_pointer != Color.BLACK), key=lambda p: np.linalg.norm(p - centroid))

    # Compute the vector from the centroid to the tip
    vector = np.array(tip) - centroid

    # Quantize the vector to one of the cardinal directions
    if abs(vector[0]) > abs(vector[1]):  # More horizontal
        direction = "E" if vector[0] > 0 else "W"
    else:  # More vertical
        direction = "S" if vector[1] > 0 else "N"

    return direction

def generate_input():
    # Create a blank grid with a random background color
    background_color = np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    grid_size = np.random.randint(5, 15)
    grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), background_color)

    # Generate a random pointer-shaped object
    pointer_length = np.random.randint(3, grid_size - 1)
    pointer = np.full((pointer_length, pointer_length), Color.BLACK)

    # Randomly choose the tip position and draw the pointer
    tip_x, tip_y = np.random.randint(0, pointer_length, size=2)
    draw_line(pointer, tip_x, tip_y, length=pointer_length, direction=(1 if tip_x < pointer_length / 2 else -1, 1 if tip_y < pointer_length / 2 else -1), color=np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK))

    # Place the pointer randomly on the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, pointer, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, pointer, x, y)

    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **Main Function**:
   - Finds the pointer-shaped object in the grid using `find_connected_components`.
   - Calculates the centroid and the tip of the pointer to determine the direction vector.
   - Quantizes this direction vector to one of the four cardinal directions (N, S, E, W).

2. **Generate Input**:
   - Generates a grid of random size and a random background color.
   - Creates a pointer-shaped object by drawing a line with a random direction and color.
   - Places the pointer randomly on the grid.

This code provides a deterministic transformation (`main`) and a stochastic input generation (`generate_input`) as required for the puzzle.
