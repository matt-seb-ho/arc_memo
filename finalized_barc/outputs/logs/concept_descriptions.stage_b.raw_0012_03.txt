Certainly! Let's design the new puzzle based on the description provided.

**Concepts:**
- Hole filling
- Guide object
- Target object
- Enclosed regions
- Non-overlapping placement

**Description:**
The input consists of a guide object with enclosed holes and a separate target object. Identify interior holes within the guide object (regions not connected to the border). Fill these holes using the target object by fitting its pixels or blocks into the hole geometry without overlapping existing non-background pixels. Continue filling until all holes are filled or no more legal placements are possible. The output grid shows previously empty regions inside the guide object filled with the target object's pixels.

Here is the implementation of the puzzle:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# hole filling, guide object, target object, enclosed regions, non-overlapping placement

# description:
# The input consists of a guide object with enclosed holes and a separate target object. The goal is to fill the interior holes within the guide object using the target object by fitting its pixels or blocks into the hole geometry without overlapping existing non-background pixels. The output grid shows previously empty regions inside the guide object filled with the target object's pixels.

def main(input_grid):
    # Detect the guide object and the target object
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8)
    
    # Assuming the larger object is the guide and the smaller one is the target
    guide_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))
    target_object = min(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))
    
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    
    # Identify the interior holes within the guide object
    guide_interior_mask = object_interior(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)
    holes_mask = guide_interior_mask & (guide_object == Color.BLACK)

    # Try to fill each hole with the target object
    for x, y in np.argwhere(holes_mask):
        try:
            # Attempt to place the target object at this hole position
            blit_sprite(output_grid, target_object, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
            # Update the hole mask to prevent overlap
            holes_mask[x:x+target_object.shape[0], y:y+target_object.shape[1]] = False
        except ValueError:
            # If placement is not possible, continue with the next position
            continue

    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with a guide object and a target object
    width, height = np.random.randint(12, 16), np.random.randint(12, 16)
    grid = np.full((width, height), Color.BLACK)

    # Generate a guide object with enclosed holes
    guide_object = random_sprite(width-4, height-4, color_palette=[Color.BLUE], background=Color.BLACK)
    guide_x, guide_y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, padding=2)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, guide_x, guide_y)

    # Create holes in the guide object
    num_holes = np.random.randint(1, 4)
    for _ in range(num_holes):
        hole_size = np.random.randint(2, 4)
        hole_x, hole_y = np.random.randint(1, guide_object.shape[0]-hole_size), np.random.randint(1, guide_object.shape[1]-hole_size)
        guide_object[hole_x:hole_x+hole_size, hole_y:hole_y+hole_size] = Color.BLACK

    # Blit the guide object back with holes
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, guide_x, guide_y)

    # Generate a target object
    target_size = np.random.randint(2, 4)
    target_object = random_sprite(target_size, target_size, color_palette=[Color.RED], background=Color.BLACK)

    # Place the target object separately on the grid
    target_x, target_y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, target_object, padding=2, border_size=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, target_object, target_x, target_y)

    return grid
```

In this puzzle, the `main` function identifies the guide and target objects, detects holes in the guide, and attempts to fill them using the target object. The `generate_input` function creates randomized grids with a guide object containing holes and a separate target object placed on the grid.
