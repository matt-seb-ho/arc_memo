Let's implement the puzzle as described. The task is to identify a unique guide object based on a distinct attribute (e.g., color or size), use its anchor point as a starting point, and count the number of enclosed regions (holes) in the grid originating from this guide's position.

Here's the code for the puzzle:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, unique selection, anchor point, hole counting

# description:
# The input grid consists of various colored objects on a black background. Identify the unique guide object based on a distinct attribute (e.g., color or size).
# Use the guide's anchor point (e.g., centroid or top-left corner) as the starting point. From this anchor, count the number of enclosed regions (holes) in the grid.
# The output is a count of these holes originating from the guide's position.

def main(input_grid):
    # Identify all objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)

    # Determine the unique guide object based on a distinct attribute
    # For simplicity, let's assume the guide object is the largest object by size
    guide_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))

    # Find the anchor point of the guide object
    anchor_x, anchor_y = object_position(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK, anchor='center')

    # Count the holes originating from the guide's position
    # A hole is defined as a fully enclosed black region
    enclosed_holes = 0
    guide_interior = object_interior(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Iterate over the grid to count enclosed black regions starting from the guide's anchor point
    def is_hole(x, y):
        # Use flood fill algorithm to determine if a region is a hole
        if guide_interior[x, y] or input_grid[x, y] != Color.BLACK:
            return False
        flood_fill = np.zeros_like(input_grid, dtype=bool)
        stack = [(x, y)]
        while stack:
            cx, cy = stack.pop()
            if flood_fill[cx, cy] or guide_interior[cx, cy] or input_grid[cx, cy] != Color.BLACK:
                continue
            flood_fill[cx, cy] = True
            for nx, ny in [(cx-1, cy), (cx+1, cy), (cx, cy-1), (cx, cy+1)]:
                if 0 <= nx < input_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= ny < input_grid.shape[1]:
                    stack.append((nx, ny))
        # If flood fill reached any point outside the guide object, it's not a hole
        return not np.any(flood_fill & ~guide_interior)

    # Check for holes around the anchor point
    for dx in [-1, 1]:
        for dy in [-1, 1]:
            if is_hole(anchor_x + dx, anchor_y + dy):
                enclosed_holes += 1

    return enclosed_holes

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with a random number of objects
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 20, size=2)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)

    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)

    for _ in range(num_objects):
        color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
        width, height = np.random.randint(2, 5, size=2)
        sprite = random_sprite(width, height, color_palette=[color], background=Color.BLACK, symmetry="not_symmetric")

        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1, border_size=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
        except ValueError:
            continue

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
- **`main` function**:
  - Identifies all connected objects in the grid.
  - Selects the largest object as the guide object.
  - Uses the center of the guide object as the anchor point.
  - Counts the enclosed black regions (holes) starting from the guide's anchor point using a flood fill algorithm.

- **`generate_input` function**:
  - Creates a grid with a random size and places a few colored objects randomly.
  - Ensures there is a sufficient number of objects to test the puzzle logic.

This code implements the described puzzle and provides a stochastic input generator and a deterministic transformation function.
