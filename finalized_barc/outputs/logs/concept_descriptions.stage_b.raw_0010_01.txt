Here's an implementation of the new puzzle based on the provided description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, starting point, position-based transformation

# description:
# In the input you will see a grid with multiple colored objects. One of these objects is uniquely colored and serves as the 
# guide object. The task is to identify the guide object and use its position as a reference point. Starting from the guide object's 
# position, transform the grid by mirroring the objects across a vertical axis passing through the guide object's position.

def main(input_grid):
    # Identify the guide object, which is the uniquely colored object in the grid
    all_colors = np.unique(input_grid)
    guide_color = [color for color in all_colors if np.sum(input_grid == color) == 1][0]
    
    # Find the position of the guide object
    guide_position = np.argwhere(input_grid == guide_color)[0]
    guide_x = guide_position[0]
    
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    
    # Mirror the objects across the vertical axis passing through the guide object's position
    for row in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for col in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[row, col] != Color.BLACK:
                # Calculate the mirrored position
                mirrored_col = 2 * guide_x - col
                if 0 <= mirrored_col < input_grid.shape[1]:
                    output_grid[row, mirrored_col] = input_grid[row, col]
    
    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Define the grid size
    n, m = np.random.randint(5, 10), np.random.randint(5, 10)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK, dtype=int)
    
    # Choose a unique color for the guide object
    guide_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.ALL_COLORS - {Color.BLACK}))
    
    # Place the guide object in the grid
    guide_x = np.random.randint(0, n)
    guide_y = np.random.randint(0, m)
    grid[guide_x, guide_y] = guide_color
    
    # Place other random colored objects in the grid
    num_objects = np.random.randint(2, 5)
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        obj_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.ALL_COLORS - {Color.BLACK, guide_color}))
        obj_sprite = random_sprite(n=2, m=2, color_palette=[obj_color], density=0.5)
        
        # Find a location for the sprite such that it does not overlap with other objects or the guide object
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, obj_sprite, padding=1, padding_connectivity=8)
            blit_sprite(grid, obj_sprite, x=x, y=y)
        except ValueError:
            continue
    
    return grid
```

### Explanation:
1. **Main Function**:
   - **Guide Object Identification**: The uniquely colored object is identified as the guide object.
   - **Transformation**: The grid is mirrored across the vertical axis passing through the guide object's position. This involves flipping the columns of each row symmetrically around the guide object's column.
   
2. **Generate Input Function**:
   - **Grid Initialization**: A grid is initialized with a random size.
   - **Guide Object Placement**: A uniquely colored object is placed at a random position.
   - **Other Objects**: Randomly colored objects are added to the grid, ensuring they do not overlap with each other or the guide object.
