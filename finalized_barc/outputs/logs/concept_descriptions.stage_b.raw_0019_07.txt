Here's an implementation of the new puzzle based on the provided description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# unique color identification, guide object selection, connected components

# description:
# Input consists of multiple distinct objects on a grid, each with a unique color.
# Identify the guide object as the one whose color is not shared by any other object in the grid.
# The output is a transformation where the guide object is highlighted based on its unique color, while all other objects remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all objects in the input grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, monochromatic=True, connectivity=8, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    # Get the color of each object
    object_color_map = {tuple(object_colors(obj, background=Color.BLACK)): obj for obj in objects}
    
    # Determine the unique color
    color_counts = {}
    for color in object_color_map.keys():
        color_counts[color] = color_counts.get(color, 0) + 1
    
    unique_color = None
    for color, count in color_counts.items():
        if count == 1:
            unique_color = color
            break
    
    # Create the output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Highlight the guide object with unique color
    if unique_color:
        guide_object = object_color_map[unique_color]
        guide_mask = guide_object != Color.BLACK
        output_grid[guide_mask] = Color.YELLOW  # Highlight the unique object with yellow
    
    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Initialize grid dimensions
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 15, size=2)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Define possible colors
    colors = list(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    np.random.shuffle(colors)
    
    # Create multiple distinct objects with unique colors
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        if not colors:
            break
        color = colors.pop()
        sprite_size = np.random.randint(2, 4, size=2)
        sprite = random_sprite(sprite_size[0], sprite_size[1], color_palette=[color])
        
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            continue
    
    return grid
```

### Explanation

1. **Concepts**: The puzzle focuses on identifying a unique color among several objects, highlighting the object with this unique color.

2. **Description**: You have a grid with multiple objects, each with a unique color. The task is to identify the object with a color that is not shared by any other object and highlight it.

3. **`main` Function**:
   - It first finds all connected components (objects) within the grid.
   - It maps each object to its color and counts the occurrences of each color.
   - Identifies the color that appears only once.
   - Highlights the object with the unique color by changing its color to yellow in the output grid.

4. **`generate_input` Function**:
   - Randomly generates a grid of objects, ensuring each object has a unique color.
   - Uses a shuffled list of colors to assign a unique color to each object on the grid.
   - Ensures objects are placed without overlap using padding.

This implementation leverages `common.py` functions effectively to perform the required operations.
