Here's an implementation of the described puzzle, where we fill enclosed holes in a guide object using a target object:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# hole filling, guide object, target object, enclosed regions, non-overlapping placement

# description:
# The input consists of a guide object with enclosed holes and a separate target object.
# The goal is to fill the interior holes within the guide object (regions not connected to the border) with the target object.
# The target object should be fitted into the hole geometry without overlapping existing non-background pixels.
# Filling continues until all holes are filled or no more legal placements are possible.
# The output grid shows previously empty regions inside the guide object filled with the target object's pixels.

def main(input_grid):
    # Extract the guide object and target object
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=False)
    guide_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))  # Assume largest object is the guide
    target_object = min(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))  # Assume smallest object is the target

    # Create an output grid that starts as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # Find the interior holes in the guide object
    interior_mask = object_interior(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)
    holes = np.argwhere(interior_mask & (guide_object == Color.BLACK))

    # Attempt to fill each hole with the target object
    for x, y in holes:
        try:
            # Try to place the target object at this hole location
            blit_sprite(output_grid, target_object, x, y, background=Color.BLACK)
            # If blit is successful, mark this hole as filled
            for i in range(target_object.shape[0]):
                for j in range(target_object.shape[1]):
                    if target_object[i, j] != Color.BLACK:
                        interior_mask[x+i, y+j] = False
        except ValueError:
            # If placement isn't possible, move to the next hole
            continue

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with random size
    width = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    height = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    grid = np.full((width, height), Color.BLACK)

    # Create a guide object with enclosed holes
    guide_object = random_sprite(np.random.randint(5, 10), np.random.randint(5, 10), density=0.8, color_palette=[Color.BLUE], background=Color.BLACK)
    guide_object = np.pad(guide_object, 2, constant_values=Color.BLACK)  # Pad to ensure it's fully enclosed
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, x, y)

    # Create a target object
    target_object = random_sprite(np.random.randint(2, 4), np.random.randint(2, 4), density=0.5, color_palette=[Color.RED], background=Color.BLACK)
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, target_object, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, target_object, x, y)

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
1. **Concepts and Description**: This puzzle involves detecting enclosed holes within a guide object and filling them with a separate target object. The process involves finding connected components, identifying interior regions, and placing objects without overlaps.

2. **`main` Function**: 
   - Extracts the guide and target objects from the input grid.
   - Identifies interior holes in the guide object that are not connected to the border.
   - Attempts to fill these holes with the target object, checking for potential placements without overlaps.

3. **`generate_input` Function**:
   - Randomly creates a guide object with potential interior holes.
   - Randomly creates a target object smaller than the guide object.
   - Places both objects onto the input grid.

This puzzle encourages students to think about spatial placement and object filling in a constrained environment.
