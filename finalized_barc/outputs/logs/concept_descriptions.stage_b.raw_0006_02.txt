Certainly! Let's implement the puzzle based on the description provided:

Concepts: 
- line drawing
- pixel connectivity
- grid update

Description: 
Given a grid with two distinct pixels marked as start and end, draw a straight line connecting these two pixels using a specified color. The line is drawn using pixel connectivity, updating the grid by coloring each pixel along the path with the given color. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

Below is the implementation of the puzzle:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# line drawing, pixel connectivity, grid update

# description:
# In the input you will see a grid with a single start pixel and a single end pixel of different colors.
# To make the output grid, draw a straight line connecting these two pixels using a specified color.
# The line is drawn using pixel connectivity, updating the grid by coloring each pixel along the path with the given color.
# The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Copy the input to the output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Find the start and end pixels
    start_color = Color.RED  # Assume start pixel color
    end_color = Color.BLUE  # Assume end pixel color
    line_color = Color.GREEN  # Use green color for the line

    # Get the position of start and end pixels
    start_pos = np.argwhere(input_grid == start_color)[0]
    end_pos = np.argwhere(input_grid == end_color)[0]

    # Extract coordinates
    start_x, start_y = start_pos
    end_x, end_y = end_pos

    # Calculate the differences
    dx = end_x - start_x
    dy = end_y - start_y

    # Determine the number of steps
    steps = max(abs(dx), abs(dy))

    # Calculate the increments
    x_increment = dx / steps
    y_increment = dy / steps

    # Draw the line by updating the grid
    for step in range(steps + 1):
        x = int(start_x + step * x_increment)
        y = int(start_y + step * y_increment)
        output_grid[x, y] = line_color

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate the background grid
    n = m = np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)

    # Choose two distinct colors for start and end pixels
    start_color = Color.RED
    end_color = Color.BLUE

    # Place start pixel
    start_x, start_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    grid[start_x, start_y] = start_color

    # Place end pixel, ensuring it is different from start
    end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    while end_x == start_x and end_y == start_y:
        end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    grid[end_x, end_y] = end_color

    return grid
```

### Explanation:
1. **`main` Function**:
   - It identifies the start and end pixel positions on the grid.
   - Using basic line interpolation, it calculates the path connecting these two pixels.
   - A straight line is drawn by incrementally updating the grid with the specified line color.

2. **`generate_input` Function**:
   - It creates a grid of random size and places two distinct colored pixels (start and end) at random positions.
   - Ensures the start and end pixels are not at the same position.

These functions together create a puzzle where the objective is to determine the line drawing transformation from the inputs.
