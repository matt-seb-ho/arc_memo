Here is the implementation of the puzzle you described, which involves dealing with obstacles and finding paths around them:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# obstacles, path blocking, line drawing, detours

# description:
# In the input, you will see a grid with a starting point marked in blue and an intended endpoint marked in red. There are also obstacles of a different color scattered across the grid.
# The task is to draw a green line from the start to the end while avoiding obstacles. If the line encounters an obstacle, a detour around the obstacle should be made, ensuring the path connects the start and end without overwriting obstacles.

def main(input_grid):
    # Plan:
    # 1. Identify the starting and ending points.
    # 2. Identify the obstacles.
    # 3. Use a simple pathfinding algorithm to draw a continuous line from the start to the end, avoiding obstacles.

    # Set background and identify colors
    background = Color.BLACK
    start_color = Color.BLUE
    end_color = Color.RED
    obstacle_color = Color.GREY
    path_color = Color.GREEN

    # Locate start and end points
    start_points = np.argwhere(input_grid == start_color)
    end_points = np.argwhere(input_grid == end_color)
    obstacles = np.argwhere(input_grid == obstacle_color)

    if len(start_points) == 0 or len(end_points) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Start or End point missing in the grid")

    start_x, start_y = start_points[0]
    end_x, end_y = end_points[0]

    # Function to find path avoiding obstacles
    def find_path(start, end, obstacles):
        from queue import Queue

        # Directions: right, down, left, up
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        visited = set()
        queue = Queue()
        queue.put((start, []))

        while not queue.empty():
            current_pos, path = queue.get()
            if current_pos == end:
                return path

            for dx, dy in directions:
                new_pos = (current_pos[0] + dx, current_pos[1] + dy)
                if new_pos not in visited and 0 <= new_pos[0] < input_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= new_pos[1] < input_grid.shape[1]:
                    if input_grid[new_pos] not in {obstacle_color, start_color}:
                        visited.add(new_pos)
                        new_path = path + [new_pos]
                        queue.put((new_pos, new_path))

        return []

    # Find path
    path = find_path((start_x, start_y), (end_x, end_y), obstacles)

    # Draw the path on the grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    for x, y in path:
        if output_grid[x, y] != start_color and output_grid[x, y] != end_color:
            output_grid[x, y] = path_color

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid with a start, end, and obstacles
    width, height = np.random.randint(10, 20, size=2)
    grid = np.full((width, height), Color.BLACK)

    # Place start and end points
    start_x, start_y = np.random.randint(0, width), np.random.randint(0, height)
    end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, width), np.random.randint(0, height)

    grid[start_x, start_y] = Color.BLUE
    grid[end_x, end_y] = Color.RED

    # Place obstacles randomly
    num_obstacles = np.random.randint(5, 15)
    for _ in range(num_obstacles):
        obs_x, obs_y = np.random.randint(0, width), np.random.randint(0, height)
        if grid[obs_x, obs_y] == Color.BLACK:  # Ensure not overwriting start/end
            grid[obs_x, obs_y] = Color.GREY

    # Ensure there is a possible path by removing any direct path obstacles
    if abs(start_x - end_x) + abs(start_y - end_y) < num_obstacles:
        return generate_input()

    return grid
```

This puzzle involves finding a path from a starting point to an endpoint on a grid, navigating around obstacles without overwriting them. The `main` function finds a path using a simple queue-based breadth-first search (BFS) to ensure it can navigate around obstacles. The `generate_input` function creates a grid with random start, end, and obstacle placements, ensuring there is a possible path between the start and end points.
