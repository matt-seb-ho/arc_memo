Here's the implementation of the puzzle as described:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# parity counting, guide object, color restriction

# description:
# The input consists of a grid with various colored pixels and a designated guide object.
# The task is to count the number of pixels within the guide object that have either odd or even color values.
# If a specific color or set of colors is provided, restrict the count to those colors only; otherwise, consider all colors present in the guide object.
# The output is the total count of pixels satisfying the chosen parity condition.

def main(input_grid: np.ndarray, guide_object: np.ndarray, parity: str = "even", restricted_colors: List[str] = None) -> int:
    assert parity in ["even", "odd"], "Parity must be 'even' or 'odd'."
    
    # Flatten the guide object to obtain all relevant positions within the grid
    guide_positions = np.argwhere(guide_object != Color.BLACK)
    
    # Count the pixels based on the defined parity and restricted colors
    count = 0
    for x, y in guide_positions:
        pixel_color = input_grid[x, y]
        
        # Check if the color is within the restricted set, if provided
        if restricted_colors is None or pixel_color in restricted_colors:
            # Convert the color to an integer value (for parity check)
            color_value = list(Color.NOT_BLACK).index(pixel_color)
            
            # Check parity condition
            if parity == "even" and color_value % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
            elif parity == "odd" and color_value % 2 != 0:
                count += 1
    
    return count

def generate_input() -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, str, List[str]]:
    n, m = np.random.randint(5, 10), np.random.randint(5, 10)
    grid = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), (n, m))
    
    guide_object_size = np.random.randint(2, 4)
    guide_object = random_sprite(n=guide_object_size, m=guide_object_size, 
                                 color_palette=[Color.BLACK, Color.GREY], density=0.5)
    
    # Place guide object randomly within the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, x, y)
    
    # Randomly choose parity and restricted colors
    parity = np.random.choice(["even", "odd"])
    if np.random.rand() > 0.5:
        restricted_colors = list(np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), np.random.randint(1, 4), replace=False))
    else:
        restricted_colors = None
    
    return grid, guide_object, parity, restricted_colors
```

This puzzle involves counting pixels within a guide object based on parity (odd/even) and optional color restrictions. The `main` function performs the counting, while the `generate_input` function creates a stochastic grid and guide object, optionally restricting the counting to specific colors.
