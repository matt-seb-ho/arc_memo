Let's design a new puzzle based on the description provided:

### Puzzle Design

**Concepts**: Line drawing, pixel connectivity, grid update

**Description**: 
Given a grid with two distinct pixels marked as start and end, draw a straight line connecting these two pixels using a specified color. The line is drawn using pixel connectivity, updating the grid by coloring each pixel along the path with the given color. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

Here is the implementation of the puzzle:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *
import random

# concepts:
# line drawing, pixel connectivity, grid update

# description:
# Given a grid with two distinct pixels marked as start and end, draw a straight line connecting these two pixels using a specified color.
# The line is drawn using pixel connectivity, updating the grid by coloring each pixel along the path with the given color.
# The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # make output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # find the start and end positions
    start_x, start_y = np.where(input_grid == Color.RED)
    end_x, end_y = np.where(input_grid == Color.BLUE)

    # get the coordinates of the start and end pixels
    start_x, start_y = start_x[0], start_y[0]
    end_x, end_y = end_x[0], end_y[0]

    # Determine the color to use for the line
    line_color = Color.GREEN

    # Use Bresenham's line algorithm to draw a line between start and end points
    def bresenham(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        dx = abs(x2 - x1)
        dy = abs(y2 - y1)
        sx = 1 if x1 < x2 else -1
        sy = 1 if y1 < y2 else -1
        err = dx - dy

        while True:
            output_grid[x1, y1] = line_color
            if x1 == x2 and y1 == y2:
                break
            e2 = err * 2
            if e2 > -dy:
                err -= dy
                x1 += sx
            if e2 < dx:
                err += dx
                y1 += sy

    # Draw the line
    bresenham(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid size
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 20), np.random.randint(10, 20)
    grid = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)

    # Randomly choose start and end colors
    start_color, end_color = Color.RED, Color.BLUE

    # Randomly place start and end pixels on the grid
    start_x, start_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)

    # Ensure start and end positions are not the same
    while start_x == end_x and start_y == end_y:
        end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)

    # Place the start and end colors on the grid
    grid[start_x, start_y] = start_color
    grid[end_x, end_y] = end_color

    return grid
```

### Explanation
- **`main` Function**: 
  - Identifies the start (`RED`) and end (`BLUE`) pixels.
  - Uses Bresenham's algorithm to draw a line connecting the start and end points with a `GREEN` color.
  - Returns the updated grid.

- **`generate_input` Function**:
  - Creates a grid of random size between 10x10 and 20x20.
  - Places a `RED` pixel and a `BLUE` pixel at random locations, ensuring they are not the same.
  - Returns the grid with the placed start and end markers.

This puzzle challenges students to determine the path-drawing logic connecting two points on a grid using a specific color, enhancing their understanding of line drawing algorithms and grid transformations.
