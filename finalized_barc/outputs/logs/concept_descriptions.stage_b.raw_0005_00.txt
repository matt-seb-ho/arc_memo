Certainly! Let's design the puzzle based on the provided description and using functions from the `common.py` library. We'll implement the `generate_input` function to create stochastic inputs, and the `main` function to apply the deterministic transformation.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, color propagation, hole filling

# description:
# Identify a guide object by its unique color in the grid. Use this color to fill all enclosed regions (holes) within the grid.
# A hole is a region of background (0) pixels completely surrounded by non-background pixels. The guide object's color is propagated
# to fill these holes, ensuring all other non-hole areas remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Detect all objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)
    
    # Create output grid starting as a copy of the input
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    
    # Identify the guide object by its unique color
    guide_color = None
    for obj in objects:
        colors = object_colors(obj, background=Color.BLACK)
        if len(colors) == 1:
            guide_color = colors[0]
            break
    
    # If no guide color is found, return the grid unchanged
    if guide_color is None:
        return output_grid
    
    # Find all holes in the grid
    interior_mask = object_interior(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK)
    boundary_mask = object_boundary(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK)
    holes_mask = interior_mask & ~boundary_mask & (input_grid == Color.BLACK)

    # Fill the holes with the guide color
    output_grid[holes_mask] = guide_color

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a random grid size
    grid_size = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Generate a random guide color
    guide_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    # Create a guide object with a unique color
    guide_width, guide_height = np.random.randint(3, 6), np.random.randint(3, 6)
    guide_object = np.full((guide_width, guide_height), guide_color)
    guide_x, guide_y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, padding=1, border_size=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, guide_x, guide_y)
    
    # Create random enclosed shapes to form potential holes
    num_shapes = np.random.randint(1, 4)
    for _ in range(num_shapes):
        shape_width, shape_height = np.random.randint(3, 8), np.random.randint(3, 8)
        shape = random_sprite(shape_width, shape_height, color_palette=[Color.BLACK, np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))], background=Color.BLACK)
        shape_x, shape_y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, shape, padding=1, border_size=1)
        blit_sprite(grid, shape, shape_x, shape_y)
    
    return grid
```

### Explanation:

1. **`main` Function:**
   - **Object Detection:** We use `find_connected_components` to identify objects in the grid.
   - **Guide Object Identification:** The guide object is identified by its unique color.
   - **Hole Identification:** Holes are detected using a combination of `object_interior` and `object_boundary` to ensure they are completely surrounded.
   - **Color Propagation:** The guide color is used to fill these detected holes.

2. **`generate_input` Function:**
   - **Grid Setup:** A random size grid is generated.
   - **Guide Object Creation:** A guide object with a unique color is placed on the grid.
   - **Shape Creation:** Random enclosed shapes are added to form potential holes. The shapes are placed ensuring no overlap, using `random_free_location_for_sprite`.

This setup provides a creative challenge for middle-schoolers to understand color propagation and enclosed regions in a grid.
