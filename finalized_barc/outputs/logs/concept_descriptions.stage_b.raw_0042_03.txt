To design the puzzle based on the given description, we will create a function `main` to implement the transformation, and a function `generate_input` to provide stochastic inputs. The puzzle involves identifying a guide object with a unique color and using it to draw a line between two specified points, overwriting the background cells with the guide object's color while leaving other colored cells unchanged.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, color transfer, line drawing

# description:
# In the input grid, you will see a guide object colored in a unique color and two points marked with different colors.
# Use the guide object's color to draw a straight line connecting the two points, overwriting the background cells.
# Ensure that the line only passes through background cells and does not overwrite any non-background colored cells.

def main(input_grid):
    # Identify the unique guide object color
    unique_colors = set(np.unique(input_grid))
    guide_color = next((color for color in unique_colors if np.sum(input_grid == color) == 1), None)

    # Ensure guide color is identified
    assert guide_color is not None, "Guide object color not found"

    # Find the positions of the two points (assuming they are marked with different colors)
    point_positions = [(x, y) for x, y in np.argwhere(input_grid != Color.BLACK) if input_grid[x, y] != guide_color]

    # Ensure exactly two points are identified
    assert len(point_positions) == 2, "Exactly two points must be marked with different colors"

    # Extract the start and end points
    (start_x, start_y), (end_x, end_y) = point_positions

    # Copy the input grid to the output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Draw the line between the two points using the guide object's color
    draw_line(output_grid, start_x, start_y, end_x=end_x, end_y=end_y, color=guide_color, stop_at_color=list(Color.NOT_BLACK))

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Define grid dimensions
    grid_size = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), Color.BLACK)

    # Randomly choose a unique guide color
    guide_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))

    # Place the guide object (single pixel) at a random location
    guide_x, guide_y = np.random.randint(0, grid_size, size=2)
    grid[guide_x, guide_y] = guide_color

    # Randomly choose two distinct colors for the points
    point_colors = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK - {guide_color}), size=2, replace=False)

    # Select random locations for the two points ensuring they are not the same or on the guide object
    point1_x, point1_y = guide_x, guide_y
    point2_x, point2_y = guide_x, guide_y
    while (point1_x == guide_x and point1_y == guide_y) or (point2_x == guide_x and point2_y == guide_y) or (point1_x == point2_x and point1_y == point2_y):
        point1_x, point1_y = np.random.randint(0, grid_size, size=2)
        point2_x, point2_y = np.random.randint(0, grid_size, size=2)

    # Place the points on the grid
    grid[point1_x, point1_y] = point_colors[0]
    grid[point2_x, point2_y] = point_colors[1]

    return grid
```

### Explanation

- **`main` Function**: 
  - Identifies the unique guide object color by checking for a color that appears exactly once in the grid.
  - Locates the two points with different colors.
  - Uses `draw_line` to draw a line between the two points using the guide object's color, ensuring the line only passes through background cells.
  
- **`generate_input` Function**:
  - Creates a grid of random size filled with the background color.
  - Randomly places a guide object with a unique color.
  - Randomly selects two points with different colors, ensuring they are not positioned on the guide object and are distinct from each other.

This puzzle challenges middle-schoolers to recognize and utilize color-based cues to perform a specific transformation while adhering to constraints about which cells can be overwritten.
