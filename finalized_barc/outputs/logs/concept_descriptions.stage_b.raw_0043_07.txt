Here's an implementation of the puzzle based on the description provided:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# boolean mask, predicate evaluation, pattern recognition, template creation

# description:
# The input is a grid region (block) and a predicate function. The task is to evaluate the predicate at each cell in the block to produce a boolean mask, where each mask cell is True if the predicate is satisfied at that location, otherwise False. This mask serves as a reusable template for identifying the pattern in other grid regions.

def main(input_grid, predicate):
    # Create a boolean mask based on the predicate function
    mask = np.zeros(input_grid.shape, dtype=bool)

    # Evaluate predicate for each cell in the grid
    for x in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for y in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            mask[x, y] = predicate(input_grid[x, y])

    return mask

def generate_input():
    # Generate a grid of random size with a random color background
    n = np.random.randint(5, 15)
    m = np.random.randint(5, 15)
    grid = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK), (n, m))

    # Define a random predicate function
    selected_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    predicate = lambda cell_color: cell_color == selected_color

    return grid, predicate
```

### Explanation:

- **Main Function:** 
  - The `main` function takes an input grid and a predicate function. It evaluates the predicate at each cell to create a boolean mask. If the predicate is true for a cell, the mask at that position is set to `True`, otherwise, it's set to `False`.

- **Generate Input Function:** 
  - The `generate_input` function creates a grid with random dimensions and colors. It also generates a predicate function that checks if a cell's color matches a randomly selected color from the grid. This predicate function is then used in the `main` function to create the boolean mask.

This puzzle challenges students to understand how predicate functions can be used to evaluate conditions across a grid and produce masks that highlight certain patterns or features, which is an essential concept in pattern recognition and image processing.
