```python
# concepts: color runs, recolor, bounding box, symmetry
# description: Identify contiguous horizontal or vertical runs of cyan (color=4) in the grid. For each run, compute k as the minimum of 3 or half the run's length (rounded down). Recolor the first k and last k cells of each run to yellow (color=3), leaving the interior cells unchanged. This transformation applies symmetrically to both ends of each cyan run, capping them with yellow while preserving the run's central portion.
