Sure, let's design the puzzle based on the description provided. The puzzle involves identifying a uniquely colored object on a grid, which we will refer to as the "guide object", and transforming the grid to highlight this object while leaving others unchanged.

Here's how we can implement the puzzle:

1. **Concepts**: Unique color identification, guide object selection, connected components.
2. **Description**: The input consists of multiple distinct objects on a grid, each with a unique color. Identify the guide object as the one whose color is not shared by any other object in the grid. The output is a transformation where the guide object is selected based on its unique color, while all other objects remain unchanged.

Now, let's write the code for the `main` and `generate_input` functions:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# unique color identification, guide object selection, connected components

# description:
# Input consists of multiple distinct objects on a grid, each with a unique color. Identify the guide object as the one whose color is not shared by any other object in the grid. The output is a transformation where the guide object is selected based on its unique color, while all other objects remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, monochromatic=True, connectivity=4, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    # Find the unique color among all objects
    color_count = {}
    for obj in objects:
        color = object_colors(obj, background=Color.BLACK)[0]
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    
    # Identify the guide object color
    guide_color = None
    for color, count in color_count.items():
        if count == 1:
            guide_color = color
            break
    
    # Create output grid, highlighting the guide object
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    for obj in objects:
        obj_color = object_colors(obj, background=Color.BLACK)[0]
        if obj_color == guide_color:
            # Highlight the guide object
            output_grid[obj != Color.BLACK] = obj_color
        else:
            # Set other objects to black
            output_grid[obj != Color.BLACK] = Color.BLACK

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Define grid dimensions
    width, height = np.random.randint(10, 15), np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((width, height), Color.BLACK)

    # Create a list of unique colors
    available_colors = list(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    np.random.shuffle(available_colors)

    # Number of objects to place
    num_objects = np.random.randint(3, len(available_colors) + 1)

    # Place objects with unique colors
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        # Randomly select a color for the object
        color = available_colors.pop()
        
        # Generate a sprite for the object
        sprite = random_sprite(np.random.randint(1, 4), np.random.randint(1, 4), color_palette=[color])
        
        # Place the sprite on the grid
        x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1)
        blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)
    
    return grid
```

### Explanation:

- **`main` function**: 
  - Extracts all monochromatic objects from the input grid.
  - Determines the color that appears exactly once among all the objects (the unique color).
  - Constructs the output grid by highlighting the object with the unique color and setting all others to black.

- **`generate_input` function**: 
  - Randomly generates a grid with multiple objects, each having a unique color.
  - Ensures that each object has a distinct color, setting up the condition for identifying a guide object.
