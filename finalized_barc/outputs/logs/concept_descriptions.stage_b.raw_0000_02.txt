To solve the puzzle of hole counting in enclosed regions, we will implement the `generate_input` and `main` functions. The focus is on identifying connected regions inside a guide object that are not of the guide object's color, using either 4-way or 8-way connectivity. Here's the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# hole counting, enclosed regions, guide object, connectivity (4/8)

# description:
# The input grid consists of a black grid with a single guide object of a specific color, which may enclose regions of the background color (black).
# Count the number of enclosed regions (holes) within the guide object that are not of the guide object's color.
# Use specified connectivity (4 or 8) to determine whether regions are enclosed.
# The output is the integer count of such holes.

def main(input_grid, guide_color, connectivity=4):
    # Get the guide object
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=connectivity, monochromatic=True)
    guide_object = None
    for obj in objects:
        if np.any(obj == guide_color):
            guide_object = obj
            break
    
    if guide_object is None:
        return 0  # No guide object found

    # Create a mask for the interior of the guide object
    interior_mask = object_interior(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Identify and count holes in the interior
    hole_count = 0
    visited = np.zeros(input_grid.shape, dtype=bool)
    for x, y in np.argwhere(interior_mask):
        if not visited[x, y] and guide_object[x, y] == Color.BLACK:
            # Find the connected component of this black region
            hole = find_connected_components(input_grid[x-1:x+2, y-1:y+2], background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=connectivity, monochromatic=True)
            hole_count += 1
            # Mark these as visited
            for hx, hy in np.argwhere(hole[0]):
                visited[hx + x - 1, hy + y - 1] = True

    return hole_count


def generate_input():
    # Create a 15x15 black grid
    grid_size = 15
    grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Create a guide object with a hole
    guide_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    guide_object_size = np.random.randint(5, 10)
    guide_object = np.full((guide_object_size, guide_object_size), guide_color)
    
    # Hollow out some interior to create holes
    num_holes = np.random.randint(1, 4)
    for _ in range(num_holes):
        hole_size = np.random.randint(1, guide_object_size // 2)
        hole_x, hole_y = np.random.randint(1, guide_object_size - hole_size), np.random.randint(1, guide_object_size - hole_size)
        guide_object[hole_x:hole_x + hole_size, hole_y:hole_y + hole_size] = Color.BLACK
    
    # Place the guide object into the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, x, y)

    return grid, guide_color, np.random.choice([4, 8])  # Include connectivity choice for variability
```

### Explanation:

- **`main` Function**: 
  - Finds the guide object based on color.
  - Creates a mask for the interior of the guide object.
  - Counts the number of connected black regions (holes) within the interior using the specified connectivity.

- **`generate_input` Function**: 
  - Generates a grid with a guide object of a random color.
  - Creates random holes within the guide object.
  - Ensures the holes are connected using either 4-way or 8-way connectivity, also randomly chosen.

This implementation ensures that the puzzle is both challenging and educational, with a focus on spatial reasoning and connectivity concepts.
