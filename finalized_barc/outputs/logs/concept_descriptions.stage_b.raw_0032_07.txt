Certainly! Let's implement the puzzle based on the given description and concepts:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# L-shape detection, corner identification, orientation classification

# description:
# The input is a 3-pixel L-shaped triomino on a 2x2 grid. Identify which of the four corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) is unoccupied by the L-shape. 
# Output the orientation as one of "tl", "tr", "bl", or "br" corresponding to the missing corner. The grid may contain noise, but the L-shape is dominant.

def main(input_grid):
    # Since we know the grid is always 2x2, we can directly check the positions
    # to determine which corner of the grid is missing from the L-shape.
    
    # The grid is expected to have a dominant L-shape, which means three out of the four positions should be colored.
    positions = {
        (0, 0): "tl",  # Top-left
        (0, 1): "tr",  # Top-right
        (1, 0): "bl",  # Bottom-left
        (1, 1): "br"   # Bottom-right
    }
    
    # Calculate the number of colored pixels at each position
    colored_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2) if input_grid[i, j] != Color.BLACK]
    
    # Determine the missing corner
    missing_corner = set(positions.keys()) - set(colored_positions)
    
    # The missing corner should be exactly one element
    assert len(missing_corner) == 1
    
    # Return the orientation of the missing corner
    missing_corner = missing_corner.pop()
    return positions[missing_corner]

def generate_input():
    # Create a 2x2 grid and randomly select one corner position to be the missing one
    grid = np.full((2, 2), Color.BLACK, dtype=int)
    
    # Randomly choose the color for the L-shape
    l_shape_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    # Define all possible L-shape configurations
    l_shape_positions = [
        [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)],  # Missing bottom-right
        [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)],  # Missing bottom-left
        [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)],  # Missing top-right
        [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)],  # Missing top-left
    ]
    
    # Randomly select an L-shape configuration
    chosen_l_shape = np.random.choice(l_shape_positions)
    
    # Fill the chosen positions with the selected color
    for (i, j) in chosen_l_shape:
        grid[i, j] = l_shape_color
        
    # Optionally add some noise
    noise_probability = 0.1  # 10% chance to add a noise pixel
    for i in range(2):
        for j in range(2):
            if grid[i, j] == Color.BLACK and np.random.rand() < noise_probability:
                grid[i, j] = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    return grid
```

### Explanation:
1. **`main` Function**: This function directly checks the 2x2 grid for the missing corner by comparing the colored positions against a set of all possible positions. It then returns the missing corner's orientation based on predefined labels.

2. **`generate_input` Function**: This function creates a 2x2 grid where three positions are occupied by the L-shape. A random L-shape configuration is chosen, and the remaining position is potentially filled with noise to add variability. The noise is colored with a very low probability to ensure the L-shape remains dominant.

This setup ensures a deterministic transformation while providing stochastic input generation, aligning with the puzzle's description and requirements.
