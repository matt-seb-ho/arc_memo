Here is the implementation for the new puzzle based on the provided description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# pattern extrapolation, sequence prediction, feature analysis, progression detection

# description:
# Input consists of a sequence of grids representing consecutive time steps, where objects exhibit a consistent transformation pattern 
# in terms of position, size, or color. Analyze the sequence to identify the evolving pattern, such as linear movement, size change, or color shift. 
# Extrapolate the identified pattern to predict and generate the next grid in the sequence. 
# The output is a single grid that continues the detected pattern logically from the last input grid.

def main(input_grids):
    # Assume input_grids is a list of grids representing consecutive time steps
    last_grid = input_grids[-1]

    # Find all objects in the last grid
    objects = find_connected_components(last_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)

    # Create a copy of the last grid to transform
    output_grid = last_grid.copy()
    
    # Analyze each object to determine its transformation pattern
    for obj in objects:
        # Get object position, color, and size
        x, y = object_position(obj, background=Color.BLACK)
        color = object_colors(obj)[0]
        width, height = obj.shape

        # Determine the pattern of movement, size, or color change
        # For simplicity, let's assume objects move linearly in the x direction by a fixed amount
        # This can be expanded to detect more complex transformations

        # Calculate the new position
        new_x = x + 1  # Assuming a simple linear movement to the right
        new_y = y

        # Make sure the new position is within bounds
        if new_x + width <= output_grid.shape[0]:
            # Clear the previous position
            blit_sprite(output_grid, np.full_like(obj, Color.BLACK), x=x, y=y, background=Color.BLACK)
            # Place the object in its new position
            blit_sprite(output_grid, obj, x=new_x, y=new_y, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid


def generate_input():
    # Generate a sequence of grids by applying a deterministic transformation
    num_steps = 3
    grid_size = (10, 10)

    # Start with an empty grid
    grids = [np.full(grid_size, Color.BLACK)]

    # Choose a random color for the object
    color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))

    # Create an initial object at a random position
    initial_x = np.random.randint(0, grid_size[0] // 2)
    initial_y = np.random.randint(0, grid_size[1] // 2)
    object_size = (2, 2)
    initial_object = np.full(object_size, color)
    
    # Place the initial object on the first grid
    blit_sprite(grids[0], initial_object, x=initial_x, y=initial_y, background=Color.BLACK)

    # Generate subsequent grids by applying simple linear movement
    for step in range(1, num_steps):
        new_grid = grids[step-1].copy()
        new_x = initial_x + step * 1  # Move to the right
        new_y = initial_y

        if new_x + object_size[0] <= grid_size[0]:
            blit_sprite(new_grid, initial_object, x=new_x, y=new_y, background=Color.BLACK)

        grids.append(new_grid)

    return grids
```

### Explanation:

- **Concepts**: The puzzle involves pattern extrapolation, sequence prediction, feature analysis, and progression detection.
- **Description**: Given a sequence of grids representing consecutive time steps, the goal is to analyze the transformation pattern of objects (like movement) and predict the next grid in the sequence.
- **`main` function**: 
  - Processes a list of grids to predict the next state.
  - Assumes objects move linearly to the right.
  - Uses functions from `common.py` to detect objects, their positions, and move them to the new predicted position.
- **`generate_input` function**: 
  - Creates a sequence of grids by introducing a simple linear movement pattern for an object across a series of grids.
  - Randomly places an object and moves it linearly in subsequent grids to create a sequence. 

This approach captures the core idea of detecting and extrapolating patterns in a sequence of grids. You can expand this implementation to recognize and extrapolate more complex transformations, such as size changes or color shifts.
