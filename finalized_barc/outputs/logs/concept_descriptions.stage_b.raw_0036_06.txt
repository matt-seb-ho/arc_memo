Here's the implementation for your puzzle involving drawing a line between two distinct pixels using Bresenham's line algorithm. The `generate_input` function will create a grid with two distinct colored pixels marking the start and end points for the line. The `main` function will transform the grid by drawing a line between these points.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# line drawing, pixel connectivity, grid update

# description:
# Given a grid with two distinct pixels marked as start and end, draw a straight line connecting these two pixels.
# Use Bresenham's line algorithm to determine the path of the line. Update the grid by coloring each pixel along the path with a specified line color.
# All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Copy input grid to the output grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Find start and end points marked by distinct colors
    start_color, end_color = None, None
    start_pos, end_pos = None, None
    
    for color in Color.NOT_BLACK:
        positions = np.argwhere(input_grid == color)
        if len(positions) == 1:
            if start_pos is None:
                start_pos = positions[0]
                start_color = color
            else:
                end_pos = positions[0]
                end_color = color
                break
    
    assert start_pos is not None and end_pos is not None, "Start or end point not found"

    # Use Bresenham's line algorithm to draw a line between start_pos and end_pos
    def bresenham_line(x0, y0, x1, y1):
        points = []
        dx = abs(x1 - x0)
        dy = abs(y1 - y0)
        sx = 1 if x0 < x1 else -1
        sy = 1 if y0 < y1 else -1
        err = dx - dy

        while True:
            points.append((x0, y0))
            if x0 == x1 and y0 == y1:
                break
            e2 = err * 2
            if e2 > -dy:
                err -= dy
                x0 += sx
            if e2 < dx:
                err += dx
                y0 += sy
        return points

    line_points = bresenham_line(start_pos[0], start_pos[1], end_pos[0], end_pos[1])
    
    # Choose a line color different from the start and end colors
    line_color = next(color for color in Color.NOT_BLACK if color not in [start_color, end_color])

    # Update the grid with the line color
    for x, y in line_points:
        output_grid[x, y] = line_color

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid of size between 10 and 20
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 20, size=2)
    grid = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)

    # Randomly choose two different colors for start and end points
    start_color, end_color = np.random.choice([color for color in Color.NOT_BLACK], size=2, replace=False)

    # Place start and end points at random positions
    start_x, start_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)
    end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)

    # Ensure start and end points are not the same
    while (start_x, start_y) == (end_x, end_y):
        end_x, end_y = np.random.randint(0, n), np.random.randint(0, m)

    grid[start_x, start_y] = start_color
    grid[end_x, end_y] = end_color

    return grid
```

This implementation uses Bresenham's line algorithm to draw a line between two distinct points on a grid. The `generate_input` function creates a new grid with two distinct colored pixels representing the start and end points for the line. The `main` function then draws the line on the grid using a line color that is different from the start and end colors.
