Below is the implementation for the described puzzle, where the task is to identify obstacles along a planned path and navigate around them to ensure the path reaches its intended destination without overwriting existing objects.

# obstacles, path blocking, line drawing, detours

# description:
# In the input, you will see a grid with a start point marked by a green pixel and an end point marked by a red pixel.
# There are several obstacles marked by blue pixels. The task is to draw a continuous line from the green start point to the red end point.
# The line should be drawn in yellow and must avoid any blue obstacles by creating detours around them.

This code defines a puzzle where the goal is to draw a path from a start point to an end point while avoiding obstacles. The `generate_input` function creates a grid with random obstacles and ensures that a path is possible between the start and end points. The `main` function uses a pathfinding algorithm to navigate around obstacles and draw the path.
