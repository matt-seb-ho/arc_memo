Let's implement the puzzle according to the provided description. The puzzle involves identifying and selecting a "guide" object based on its unique color, while keeping all other objects unchanged. We'll use the helper functions from `common.py` to achieve this.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# unique color identification, guide object selection, connected components

# description:
# Input consists of multiple distinct objects on a grid, each with a unique color. Identify the guide object as the one whose color is not shared by any other object in the grid. The output is a transformation where the guide object is selected based on its unique color, while all other objects remain unchanged.

def main(input_grid):
    # Extract all objects from the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)

    # Determine the color of each object
    object_color_map = {tuple(object_colors(obj, background=Color.BLACK)): obj for obj in objects}

    # Count the occurrences of each color in the objects
    color_counts = {}
    for color_tuple in object_color_map.keys():
        color = color_tuple[0]
        if color in color_counts:
            color_counts[color] += 1
        else:
            color_counts[color] = 1

    # Identify the guide object as the one with a unique color
    guide_object = None
    for color, count in color_counts.items():
        if count == 1:
            guide_object = object_color_map[(color,)]
            break

    # Create the output grid with only the guide object
    output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, Color.BLACK)
    if guide_object is not None:
        blit_object(output_grid, guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)

    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Define the grid size
    width, height = np.random.randint(10, 15), np.random.randint(10, 15)
    grid = np.full((width, height), Color.BLACK)

    # Select a set of colors, ensuring one of the colors will be unique
    all_colors = list(Color.NOT_BLACK)
    np.random.shuffle(all_colors)
    unique_color = all_colors.pop()
    other_colors = all_colors[:np.random.randint(3, 5)]

    # Generate objects with the non-unique colors
    for color in other_colors:
        for _ in range(np.random.randint(1, 3)):
            sprite = random_sprite([3, 4], [3, 4], color_palette=[color])
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)

    # Generate a single object with the unique color
    unique_sprite = random_sprite([3, 4], [3, 4], color_palette=[unique_color])
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, unique_sprite, background=Color.BLACK, border_size=1, padding=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, unique_sprite, x, y)

    return grid
```

### Explanation

- **`main` function**:
  - We first extract all objects from the input grid using `find_connected_components`.
  - We create a mapping of object colors to objects and count each color's occurrences in the grid.
  - The guide object is identified as the one having a unique color (appearing only once).
  - The output grid consists of only the guide object, with other areas filled with the background color.

- **`generate_input` function**:
  - A grid is initialized with a random size.
  - A unique color is chosen, and several other colors are selected for creating multiple objects.
  - Objects with non-unique colors are placed randomly on the grid.
  - A single object with the unique color is placed on the grid to ensure there's always a guide object.

This puzzle tests the recognition of unique colors in a grid and reinforces concepts like object detection and color identification.
