Here's a new puzzle implementation based on the provided description:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# dynamic pattern evolution, prediction, sequence analysis

# description:
# In the input you will see a sequence of grids representing consecutive time steps, 
# where objects exhibit a consistent transformation pattern in terms of position, size, or color.
# The task is to analyze the sequence to identify the evolving pattern, such as linear movement, size change, or color shift.
# Extrapolate the identified pattern to predict and generate the next grid in the sequence. The output is a single grid that continues the detected pattern logically from the last input grid.

def main(input_sequence):
    # Analyze the input sequence to detect the pattern
    num_steps = len(input_sequence)
    last_grid = input_sequence[-1]
    
    # Find the connected components (assumed to be moving objects) in the last grid
    objects = find_connected_components(last_grid, monochromatic=True, connectivity=8, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    # Prepare the output grid with the same size as the input grids
    n, m = last_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)
    
    # Process each object to predict its next position
    for obj in objects:
        # Get the object's position and color
        x, y = object_position(obj, background=Color.BLACK)

        initial_position = None
        for init_obj in first_obj:
            if object_colors(init_obj)[0] == color:
                initial_position = object_position(init_obj, background=Color.BLACK)
                break
        
        dx = (x - initial_position[0]) // (num_steps - 1)
        dy = (y - initial_position[1]) // (num_steps - 1)
        
        # Predict the next position of the object
        new_x = x + dx
        new_y = y + dy
        
        # Blit the object in the new position on the output grid
        sprite = crop(obj)
        if 0 <= new_x < n and 0 <= new_y < m:
            blit_sprite(output_grid, sprite, x=new_x, y=new_y, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    return output_grid

### Explanation:
1. **`main` Function**:
   - The `main` function processes a sequence of grids.
   - It calculates the movement pattern of each object by finding its position change per time step.
   - It predicts the next position of the object based on the detected pattern and generates a new grid with updated positions.

2. **`generate_input` Function**:
   - This function generates a sequence of grids representing time steps.
   - Each grid contains several objects that move linearly over time.
   - The movement direction and color for each object are randomly selected.
   - The function ensures that the generated sequence is consistent with the description of evolving patterns.
