# Input consists of multiple distinct objects on a grid, each with a unique color. Identify the guide object as the one whose color is not shared by any other object in the grid. The output is a transformation where the guide object is selected based on its unique color, while all other objects remain unchanged.

### Explanation:

- **Concepts:** The puzzle revolves around recognizing unique colors, identifying a guide object based on that uniqueness, and understanding connected components.
- **Description:** The task is to find an object on a grid that is the only one of its color. This object is identified as the "guide object." The output grid highlights this guide object while all other objects remain unchanged.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - `main`: This function identifies all objects and their colors. It tracks color frequencies to find the unique one, identifies the guide object, and constructs an output grid showing only this object.
  - `generate_input`: This function creates a grid with several objects of different colors, ensuring one has a unique color to serve as the guide object. The grid is randomly generated each time, providing varied inputs for testing the transformation.
