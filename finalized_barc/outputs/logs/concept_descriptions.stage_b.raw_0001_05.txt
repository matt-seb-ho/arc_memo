Below is an implementation of the puzzle described, focusing on identifying and filling holes in enclosed regions using flood-fill and background detection.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# holes, enclosed regions, flood fill, background detection

# description:
# In the input grid, there are objects drawn with a guide color, enclosing some regions that might be holes. 
# The task is to identify holes as regions of the background color that are completely enclosed by the guide color and not connected to the grid border.
# Fill these holes with the color of the enclosing guide object.

def main(input_grid):
    # Create a copy of the input grid to work on
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    
    # Find all the connected components in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, connectivity=8, monochromatic=False)
    
    # Go through each object and check for holes
    for obj in objects:
        interior_mask = object_interior(obj)
        guide_mask = obj != Color.BLACK
        
        # Find the color of the guide object
        guide_color = np.unique(obj[guide_mask])[0]
        
        # Determine the holes by finding regions inside the object that are background and enclosed
        hole_mask = interior_mask & ~guide_mask
        if np.any(hole_mask):
            # Fill these holes with the guide color
            obj[hole_mask] = guide_color
        
        # Blit the processed object back to the output grid
        blit_object(output_grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK)
    
    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a grid with random size between 10x10 and 20x20
    n = np.random.randint(10, 20)
    input_grid = np.full((n, n), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Define a guide color different from the background
    guide_color = np.random.choice(list(Color.NOT_BLACK))
    
    # Create random enclosed regions with potential holes
    num_objects = np.random.randint(1, 4)
    for _ in range(num_objects):
        # Define size and shape of the object
        rows, cols = np.random.randint(3, 7), np.random.randint(3, 7)
        obj = np.full((rows, cols), guide_color)
        
        # Carve out a hole by setting some interior pixels to background
        if np.random.rand() > 0.5:
            hole_size = np.random.randint(1, min(rows, cols) - 1)
            hole_x, hole_y = np.random.randint(1, rows - hole_size), np.random.randint(1, cols - hole_size)
            obj[hole_x:hole_x + hole_size, hole_y:hole_y + hole_size] = Color.BLACK
        
        # Find a random location to place the object in the grid
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(input_grid, obj, padding=1)
            blit_sprite(input_grid, obj, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            continue
    
    return input_grid
```

### Explanation:
- **`main` Function**: This function processes the grid to identify and fill holes. It uses connected component analysis to find objects and checks if there are any holes (background-colored regions) inside them. If such a hole is found, it fills it with the guide color of the enclosing object.
  
- **`generate_input` Function**: This function creates input grids with random objects that may have enclosed holes. Objects are placed randomly within a grid, and holes are carved out with a certain probability.

This puzzle challenges students to understand how to detect enclosed regions using topological concepts and apply flood-fill algorithms to fill these regions appropriately.
