Certainly! Let's create a puzzle based on the provided description. The puzzle involves identifying a unique guide object based on a distinct attribute, using its anchor point, and counting the number of enclosed regions (holes) in the grid from that position.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# guide object, unique selection, anchor point, hole counting

# description:
# The input is a grid with various colored objects. One object is distinctly larger than the others and serves as the guide.
# The task is to identify this guide object, use its top-left corner as the anchor point, and count the number of fully enclosed black regions (holes) in the grid.
# The output is a grid where the guide object is highlighted in red and the number of holes is displayed in the top-left corner of the grid.

def main(input_grid):
    # Find all objects in the grid
    objects = find_connected_components(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, connectivity=8, monochromatic=True)
    
    # Identify the guide object based on size
    guide_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: np.sum(obj != Color.BLACK))
    
    # Get the position of the guide object's top-left corner
    guide_x, guide_y = object_position(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK, anchor='upper left')
    
    # Count the number of fully enclosed regions (holes) in the grid
    # An enclosed region is a connected component of black pixels surrounded by non-black pixels
    hole_count = 0
    for obj in objects:
        # Check if the object is a hole (fully enclosed black region)
        if np.all(obj[obj != Color.BLACK] != Color.BLACK):
            hole_count += 1
    
    # Create the output grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    
    # Highlight the guide object in red
    guide_mask = guide_object != Color.BLACK
    output_grid[guide_mask] = Color.RED
    
    # Display the number of holes in the top-left corner
    output_grid[0, 0] = hole_count
    
    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a random grid size
    n, m = np.random.randint(10, 20, size=2)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK)
    
    # Generate guide object with a unique size (larger than other objects)
    guide_object_size = np.random.randint(4, 6)
    guide_object = random_sprite(guide_object_size, guide_object_size, color_palette=[Color.TEAL], background=Color.BLACK)
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, guide_object, padding=1, border_size=1)
    blit_sprite(grid, guide_object, x, y)
    
    # Generate other smaller objects (distractors)
    num_distractors = np.random.randint(3, 6)
    for _ in range(num_distractors):
        distractor_size = np.random.randint(2, 3)
        distractor = random_sprite(distractor_size, distractor_size, color_palette=[Color.BLUE])
        try:
            x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, distractor, padding=1, border_size=1)
            blit_sprite(grid, distractor, x, y)
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    # Add enclosed black regions (holes)
    num_holes = np.random.randint(1, 3)
    for _ in range(num_holes):
        hole_size = np.random.randint(1, 3)
        hole = random_sprite(hole_size, hole_size, color_palette=[Color.BLACK], background=Color.BLACK)
        x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, hole, padding=1, border_size=1)
        blit_sprite(grid, hole, x, y)
    
    return grid
```

### Explanation:
1. **Concepts**:
   - **Guide Object**: The largest object in the grid is identified as the guide.
   - **Unique Selection**: The guide is selected based on its size.
   - **Anchor Point**: The top-left corner of the guide object is used as a reference.
   - **Hole Counting**: The function counts fully enclosed black regions within the grid.

2. **`main` Function**:
   - Identifies the guide object by size.
   - Counts the number of fully enclosed black regions (holes).
   - Highlights the guide object in red and displays the hole count in the top-left corner.

3. **`generate_input` Function**:
   - Creates a grid with a single larger guide object and several smaller distractor objects.
   - Randomly places enclosed black regions (holes) in the grid.

This puzzle challenges the solver to identify a distinct feature (size) to select a guide and employs spatial reasoning to count holes based on topological properties.
