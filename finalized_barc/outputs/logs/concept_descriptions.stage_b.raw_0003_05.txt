Here's a new puzzle implementation based on the description provided. The puzzle involves determining the output grid's shape based on a fixed size or derived from a guide object's bounding box.

```python
from common import *

import numpy as np
from typing import *

# concepts:
# output grid shape, guide object, bounding box, zero-initialized grid

# description:
# In the input, you will see a grid with a single colored object surrounded by a black background. 
# The output grid's dimensions are determined by either a fixed size of 10x10 or derived from the smallest bounding box that can contain the guide object, 
# whichever is larger. Initialize the output grid with a zero (black) background color. The output grid's dimensions are independent of the input content but adhere to the defined shape rule.

def main(input_grid):
    # Step 1: Detect objects in the input grid
    objects = detect_objects(input_grid, background=Color.BLACK, monochromatic=True, connectivity=4)
    
    # Assuming there's only one object, use the first one as the guide object
    guide_object = objects[0]
    
    # Step 2: Determine the bounding box dimensions of the guide object
    guide_bounding_box = crop(guide_object, background=Color.BLACK)
    bounding_box_dimensions = guide_bounding_box.shape
    
    # Step 3: Determine the output grid's shape based on the fixed size or the bounding box size
    fixed_size = (10, 10)
    output_shape = (
        max(fixed_size[0], bounding_box_dimensions[0]),
        max(fixed_size[1], bounding_box_dimensions[1])
    )
    
    # Step 4: Initialize the output grid with zero (black) background color
    output_grid = np.full(output_shape, Color.BLACK, dtype=int)
    
    return output_grid

def generate_input():
    # Create a random grid size between 15x15 and 20x20
    n = np.random.randint(15, 21)
    m = np.random.randint(15, 21)
    grid = np.full((n, m), Color.BLACK, dtype=int)
    
    # Create a random colored sprite with a size between 4x4 and 8x8
    sprite_size = np.random.randint(4, 9, size=2)
    sprite = random_sprite(sprite_size[0], sprite_size[1], color_palette=[np.random.choice(Color.NOT_BLACK)])
    
    # Blit the sprite onto a random location in the grid
    x, y = random_free_location_for_sprite(grid, sprite)
    blit_sprite(grid, sprite, x, y)
    
    return grid
```

### Explanation:
- **Concepts**: The puzzle involves understanding how to determine the shape of an output grid based on either a fixed size or the bounding box of a guide object, and initializing the grid with a zero (background) color.
- **Description**: The input grid contains a single colored object. The output grid is determined by the larger of a fixed size (10x10) or the bounding box of the object. The output is initialized as black and independent of the input's specific content, except for the size determination.
