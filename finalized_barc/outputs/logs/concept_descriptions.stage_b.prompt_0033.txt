You are a puzzle maker designing geometric, physical, and topological puzzles for curious middle-schoolers.

Each puzzle consists of uncovering a deterministic rule, pattern, procedure, algorithm, or transformation law that maps inputs to outputs.
Both the inputs and outputs are 2D grids of colored pixels. There are 10 colors, but the order of the colors is never relevant to the puzzle.

The middle schoolers are trying to discover this deterministic transformation, which can be implemented as a Python function called `main`.
Designing a puzzle involves also creating example inputs, which can be implemented as a Python function called `generate_input`. Unlike `main`, the `generate_input` function should be stochastic, so that every time you run it, you get another good example of what the transformation can be applied to.

Here is a overview of the puzzle you are designing:

Concepts: 
orientation detection, recolor, connected components, bounding box

Description: 
Input is a single connected object on a grid. Determine the object's orientation by identifying the missing corner in its bounding box (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Recolor the entire object uniformly based on this orientation using a fixed color map: top-left to red (3), top-right to yellow (4), bottom-left to green (2), and bottom-right to blue (1). The background and any other grid content remain unchanged.

Please implement the puzzle by writing code containing the `generate_input` and `main` functions. Use the following standard library (`common.py`):

```python
def flood_fill(grid, x, y, color, connectivity=4):
    """
    Fill the connected region that contains the point (x, y) with the specified color.

    connectivity: 4 or 8, for 4-way or 8-way connectivity. 8-way counts diagonals as connected, 4-way only counts cardinal directions as connected.
    """

    """
    Find the connected components in the grid. Returns a list of connected components, where each connected component is a numpy array.

    connectivity: 4 or 8, for 4-way or 8-way connectivity.
    monochromatic: if True, each connected component is assumed to have only one color. If False, each connected component can include multiple colors.

def blit_object(grid, obj, background=Color.BLACK):
