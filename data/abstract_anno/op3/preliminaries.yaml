concepts:
  - concept: object
    kind: term definition
    description: a group of pixels that are treated as a single entity
  - concept: guide object
    kind: term definition
    description: an object that serves as a reference from which color/shape/position/size is used
  - concept: extract objects 
    kind: routine
    parameters:
      - name: input grid
        type: grid
        description: grid (or region of a grid) to extract objects from
      - name: single color
        type: bool 
      - name: connectivity
        type: str
        description: object connectedness (4-way, 8-way, or none). None admits non-contiguous objects.
  - concept: filter objects
    kind: routine
    output: list[object]
    parameters:
      - name: input objects
        type: list[object]
        description: the list of objects to filter
      - name: criteria
        type: Callable[[object], bool]
        description: filter criteria
    description: filter a list of objects based on some criteria
  - concept: find object
    kind: routine
    output: object
    parameters:
      - name: input objects
        type: list[object]
        description: the list of objects to search in
      - name: criteria
        type: Callable[[object], bool]
        description: criteria to find the object
    description: find an object in a list of objects based on some criteria
  - concept: create new grid
    kind: routine
    routine_subtype: grid manipulation
    parameters:
      - name: dimensions
        typing: dimensions := tuple[int, int]
        description: the dimensions of the new grid to create
    description: create a new grid with specified dimensions
    cues:
      - if input grid dimensions don't match the output grid dimensions
      - if structures from input are largely not present, it maybe more efficient to create a new grid for the output
