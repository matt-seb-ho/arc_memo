pseudocode:
  - a list of pseudocode steps that describe the transformation rule
  - a step can be a string or a dict
  - use dicts for parameterized operations:
      param name: param value
      tip: be careful about indenting the argument dict enough
  - some examples of parameters expressing control flow:
      which: if the operation only happens to certain objects (can also express multiple objects to denote a for-each operation)

summary: condense the solution into a one-liner description of the transform

concepts:
  - concept: each list entry is a dict representing a concept-- an idea used in the transform
    description: concept definition/clarification if the name needs further elaboration
    parents: a comma separated list of concept names that this concept falls under as a variation/subcategory of
    associated_concepts:
      related concept name: short description of how this concept relates to the associated concept
    relevance_cues:
      - list of what to look out for in the reference input-output grid pairs that indicate that this concept is relevant
    notes:
      - record any helpful pointers or takeaways on this concept from this solution that did not fit in the other fields
