pseudocode:
  - extract objects:
      single color: true, yellow
      connectivity: none
      patch: 3x3 
  - extract object:
      single color: true, red
      connectivity: 8-way
  - copy pattern:
      pattern: red object
      location: each guide (match orientation to red guide and its nearest yellow patch)
summary: copy a pattern to other partial patterns matching their orientation
concepts:
  - concept: object extraction
    kind: intermediate operation
    description: extract objects from the grid
    uses_params:
      single color: whether to objects can have multiple colors
      connectivity: 4-way, 8-way or none (none allows for non-connected objects)
      patch: size of the patch to extract (used for non-connected objects)
  - concept: object replication
    kind: grid manipulation
    description: copy an object to new location(s) in the output grid
    uses_params:
      object: the object to copy
      locations: where to copy the pattern (e.g., each guide), may also specify orientation
      rotation: match guide orientation to the copied object
  - concept: partial match location
    kind: parameter selection
    for_param: locations
    uses_params:
      guide: object whose pattern is checked against from partial candidates
    description: select a location if the location has a partial match with some orientation of the guide object
