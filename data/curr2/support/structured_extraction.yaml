pseudocode:
  - extract objects:
      single color: true
      connectivity: 4-way
      organization: left edge ordering left to right
  - count:
      selection criteria: single color objects
  - new output grid:
      dimensions: 1 row, count result columns
  - draw pixels:
      organization: horizontal line
      color scheme: color of single color objects from left to right
concepts: 
  - concept: extract objects
    kind: intermediate operation
    description: extract objects from the grid
    uses_params:
      single color: whether to objects can have multiple colors
      connectivity: 4-way, 8-way or none (none allows for non-connected objects)
      organization: how objects are organized in the grid (this organization should be preserved in extracted form)
  - concept: object sequence organization
    kind: parameter selection
    for_param: organization
    uses_params:
      direction: the direction in which objects are ordered (e.g., left to right, top to bottom)
    description: extract objects in a sequence based on their position in a direction
  - concept: counting
    kind: intermediate operation
    description: count some entity
    uses_params:
      selection criteria: criteria to select which objects to count
  - concept: new output grid
    kind: grid manipulation
    description: create a new grid to store results
    uses_params:
      dimensions: the size of the new grid
  - concept: draw pixels
    kind: grid manipulation
    description: draw a line in the output grid
    uses_params:
      organization: how to organize the pixels in the output grid (e.g., horizontal line)
      color scheme: what colors to use for the pixels
