pseudocode:
  - extract object:
      single color: true, blue
      connectivity: 8-way
  - replicate object:
      location: red pixels that partially match the blue object
      object: blue object
      color: red
summary: replicate a blue object to red pixels that partially match it
concepts:
  - concept: object extraction
    kind: intermediate operation
    uses_params:
      single color: whether the object can have multiple colors
      connectivity: 4-way, 8-way or none (none allows for non-connected objects)
    description: extract an object from the grid
  - concept: object replication
    kind: grid manipulation
    uses_params:
      location: where to replicate the object (e.g., red pixels that partially match the blue object)
      object: the object to replicate
      color: color of the replicated object
    description: replicate an object in the grid
  - concept: partial match location
    kind: parameter selection
    for_param: location
    uses_params:
      guide: object whose pattern is checked against from partial candidates
    description: select a location if the location has a partial match with some orientation of the guide object
