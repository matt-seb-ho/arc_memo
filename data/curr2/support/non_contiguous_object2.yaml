pseudocode:
  - split regions:
      splitting scheme: use divider line
  - extract object:
      selection criteria: above divider line
      single color: true
      connectivity: none
  - recolor:
      selection criteria: below divider and matches extracted 
      color: red
summary: extract an object above a divider line and recolor pixels below the divider line to red if they match the extracted object
concepts:

    description: a line that divides the grid into two regions
  - concept: object extraction
    kind: intermediate operation
    uses_params:
      selection criteria: criteria to select which objects to extract
      single color: whether the extracted object can have multiple colors
      connectivity: how connected the object should be (e.g., none for non-connected objects)
    description: extract an object from the grid
  - concept: recoloring
    kind: grid manipulation
    uses_params:
      selection criteria: criteria to select which objects to recolor
