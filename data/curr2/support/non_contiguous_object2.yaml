pseudocode:
  - split regions:
      splitting scheme: use divider line
  - extract object:
      selection criteria: above divider line
      single color: true
      connectivity: none
  - recolor:
      selection criteria: below divider and matches extracted 
      color: red
summary: extract an object above a divider line and recolor pixels below the divider line to red if they match the extracted object
concepts:
  - concept: split regions
    kind: intermediate operation
    description: split the grid into regions based on a scheme
    uses_params:
      splitting scheme: how to split the grid
  - concept: divider line
    kind: parameter selection
    for_param: splitting scheme
    description: a line that divides the grid into two regions
    uses_params:
      position: the position of the divider line in the grid
      orientation: whether the line is horizontal or vertical
  - concept: object extraction
    kind: intermediate operation
    description: extract an object from the grid
    uses_params:
      selection criteria: criteria to select which objects to extract
      single color: whether the extracted object can have multiple colors
      connectivity: how connected the object should be (e.g., none for non-connected objects)
  - concept: recoloring
    kind: grid manipulation
    description: recolor objects in the grid
    uses_params:
      selection criteria: criteria to select which objects to recolor
      color scheme: the color to apply to the selected objects
  - concept: guide shape match criteria
    kind: parameter selection
    for_param: selection criteria
    uses_params:
      guide shape: the shape of the guide object to match against
    description: select objects that match the shape of a guide object
