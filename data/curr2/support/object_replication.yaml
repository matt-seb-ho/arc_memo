pseudocode:
  - extract object:
      single color: true
      connectivity: 8-way
  - replicate object:
      object: extracted object
      tiling: true
      tiling directions: up, down, left, right
      tiling gap: 1 pixel
summary: replicate an object in all directions without gaps between
concepts:
  - concept: object extraction
    kind: intermediate operation
    uses_params:
      single color: whether the object can have multiple colors
      connectivity: 4-way, 8-way or none (none allows for non-connected objects)
    description: extract an object from the grid
  - concept: object replication
    kind: grid manipulation
    uses_params:
      object: the object to replicate
      tiling: whether to repeat the object as a repeating tile
      tiling directions: the directions in which to tile the object (e.g., up, down, left, right)
      tiling gap: the gap between tiled objects
    description: replicate an object in the grid
