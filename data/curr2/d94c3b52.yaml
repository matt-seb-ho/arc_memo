pseudocode:
  - extract objects:
      single color: true
      connectivity: none
      organization: 3x3 patches in grid with 1 pixel gap
  - select guide:
      selection criteria: 8 patch
  - recolor objects:
      selection criteria: shape match against guide
      color scheme: light blue
  - recolor objects:
      selection criteria: patch is between 2 color 8 patches (between along x or y axis)
      color scheme: orange
summary: read input as a grid of 3x3 sprites, and recolor all sprites that are between two cyan sprites.
concepts:
  - concept: meta grid
    kind: term definition
    description: where the pixel grid can be viewed as a grid of patches treating each patch as a cell
  - concept: extract objects
    kind: intermediate operation
    description: extract objects from the grid
    uses_params:
      single color: whether to objects can have multiple colors
      connectivity: 4-way, 8-way or none (none allows for non-connected objects)
      organization: how objects are organized in the grid (this organization should be preserved in extracted form)
  - concept: recolor
    kind: grid manipulation
    description: change color of some entity(s)
    uses_params:
      selection criteria: criteria to select which objects to recolor
      color scheme: what colors to use
  - concept: between guides criteria
    kind: parameter selection
    for_param: selection criteria
    uses_params:
      guides: several objects that define a region between them
    description: select objects that are between two guides, i.e. are aligned with 2 guide objects and are between them
