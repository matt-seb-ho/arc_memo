pseudocode:
  - scale up input grid:
      factor: 3
  - pad grid:
      padding: 3
  - replicate object:
      object: original scale input grid
      locations: wherever input grid object touches the grid's edges, in the padded section
summary: scale up by 3x, pad outside by 3 pixels, then copy the original grid to where the original grid's object touches the border.
