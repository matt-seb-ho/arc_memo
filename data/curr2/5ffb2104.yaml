pseudocode:
  - move objects:
      direction: right
      collision: true
summary: slide all objects right with collision with the right edge and between objects
concepts:
  - concept: object movement
    kind: grid manipulation
    description: move objects in the grid
    uses_params:
      direction: the direction to move the objects
      collision: whether to handle collisions with edges and other objects
    notes:
      - when moving objects with collision, final positions depend on the position of other objects. As such, the moving object order matters-- objects furthest along the movement direction should be moved first.

  - move_all.json
