{"ac0c5833":{"c2_desc":{"description":"Observation Summary:\nAcross all examples, the grids are filled with identical yellow L-shaped objects on a black background. In the outputs, some (but not all) of these yellow L-shapes have a red L-shape directly overlaid on top of them, matching their orientation and position. The selection of which yellow L-shapes receive a red overlay appears to be consistent within each example but varies between examples. The yellow L-shapes themselves are never removed or recolored; the red is always an overlay. The grids retain their size, and the positions and orientations of the L-shapes are preserved.\n\nSpeculation:\nThe transformation likely involves selecting certain yellow L-shapes and overlaying them with a red L-shape of the same orientation and position. The key idea seems to be about **object selection** and **recoloring (overlaying)**.\n\nPossible high-level ideas to consider:\n- There may be a rule for selecting which yellow L-shapes receive a red overlay (e.g., based on their position, their relationship to other L-shapes, or a pattern in the grid).\n- The operation is not about moving, rotating, or duplicating objects, but about marking or highlighting certain existing objects."}},"5ffb2104":{"c2_desc":{"description":"Observation Summary:\nAcross all examples, the same colored blocks from the input grids are preserved in the output grids, but their positions are changed. In the outputs, the blocks are always stacked vertically in the rightmost column, one after another, regardless of their initial positions. The order of stacking appears to be consistent with the order in which the blocks appear from top to bottom in the input grid.\n\nSpeculation:\nThe high-level idea seems to be about **object movement**: specifically, moving all colored blocks to the rightmost column and stacking them vertically. The rule likely involves **fixed color based selection** (all colored blocks are selected, regardless of color) and then **object movement** (move each block to the rightmost column, stacking them in a specific order)."}},"8719f442":{"c2_desc":{"description":"Observation Summary:\nAcross all examples, the input grids are 3x3 and the output grids are 15x15. The white shapes in the input are preserved in the output but are expanded or \"grown\" in a consistent way. The expansion appears to involve extending the arms or lines of the shapes and adding clusters at the ends and intersections. The background color (black) is preserved in the output. The transformation seems to be systematic and geometric, with each input shape mapped to a much larger, more complex version of itself in the output.\n\nSpeculation:\nThe high-level idea appears to involve **scaling up** or **expanding** the white shapes from the input grid into a much larger output grid, possibly by a fixed factor (from 3x3 to 15x15, suggesting a factor of 5). The expansion is not just a simple scaling; it also introduces additional structure, such as clusters at the ends and intersections of lines.\n\nOther relevant concepts may include **object replication** (repeating or extending the arms of shapes) and possibly **padding** (since the shapes do not fill the entire output grid)."}},"0a2355a6":{"c2_desc":{"description":"Observation Summary:\n- Across all examples, the input grids contain multiple cyan objects, all of which are closed shapes with a hole (i.e., each object surrounds a region of black pixels).\n- The output grids always contain the same objects in the same positions and shapes, but the color of each object is changed. The output colors are always distinct for each object in a given grid, and the set of colors used varies across examples (blue, green, red, yellow).\n- There is a one-to-one correspondence between input and output objects.\n- The background color (black) is preserved.\n\nSpeculation:\n- The transformation rule appears to involve **object extraction** (identifying each closed shape with a hole), and then **recoloring** each object with a different color in the output grid.\n- The **color scheme** seems to use a **fixed mapping** for each object within a grid, but the mapping itself may differ between examples (i.e., the same shape is not always the same color across examples).\n- The rule may involve **counting** the number of objects and assigning a unique color to each, possibly from a fixed palette.\n- The **selection criteria** for which objects to recolor appears to be \"objects with a hole\" (i.e., closed shapes that surround a region of background)."}},"d94c3b52":{"c2_desc":{"description":"Observation Summary:\nAcross all examples, the input grids contain blue and light blue blocks on a black background. The light blue blocks are larger and have distinct shapes (plus signs, hollow squares, etc.). In the outputs, the original blue and light blue blocks are preserved, and new orange blocks are added. The orange blocks tend to appear inside or adjacent to the larger light blue shapes, often filling in their centers or forming a pattern that complements the light blue shapes. The grid size remains constant in all examples.\n\nSpeculation:\nA high-level idea to consider is that the transformation rule involves detecting the larger light blue shapes and then adding orange blocks in relation to these shapes, possibly filling in their centers or adjacent areas. The rule may involve object extraction (identifying the larger light blue shapes), and then a drawing or recoloring operation to add orange blocks in specific positions relative to those shapes."}}}
