In the outputs, some (but not all) of these yellow L-shapes have a red L-shape directly overlaid on top of them, matching their orientation and position. The selection of which yellow L-shapes receive a red overlay appears to be consistent within each example but varies between examples. The yellow L-shapes themselves are never removed or recolored; the red is always an overlay. The grids retain their size, and the positions and orientations of the L-shapes are preserved.\n\nSpeculation:\nThe transformation likely involves selecting certain yellow L-shapes and overlaying them with a red L-shape of the same orientation and position. The key idea seems to be about **object selection** and **recoloring (overlaying)**.\n\nPossible high-level ideas to consider:\n- There may be a rule for selecting which yellow L-shapes receive a red overlay (e.g., based on their position, their relationship to other L-shapes, or a pattern in the grid).\n- The operation is not about moving, rotating, or duplicating objects, but about marking or highlighting certain existing objects."}},"5ffb2104":{"c2_desc_hintm":{"hint":"## grid manipulation concepts\n- concept: object movement\n  description: move objects in the grid\n\n## parameter selection concepts\nfor parameter `selection criteria`:\n- concept: fixed color based selection\n  description: select objects based on their color","description":"Observation Summary:\nAcross all examples, the same colored blocks from the input grids are preserved in the output grids, but their positions are changed.

The orange blocks tend to appear inside or adjacent to the larger light blue shapes, often filling in their centers or forming a pattern that complements the light blue shapes.
