Check if one or more of these objects are translated by a fixed offset or repositioned relative to a reference point.\n- situation: When the grid contains two distinct colored regions and one of them appears in the same location in both the input and output.\n  suggestion: Use the unchanged region as an anchor. Investigate if the other region is being repositioned relative to it (for example, being shifted so that one of its edges becomes flush with the anchor’s edge), and try applying a translation that aligns the movable region adjacent to the fixed one."}},"2685904e":{"gpt41_img":{"description":"Observation Summary:\n- All grids are 10x10.\n- The top left always contains a cyan bar (3x1), unchanged in output.\n- The bottom always contains a thick white horizontal bar, with a row of colored squares directly beneath it. The colored squares vary in color and order between examples.\n- In the output, the row of colored squares is preserved.\n- In the output, vertical bars or squares appear above the white bar, aligned with certain colored squares. The color and number of these vertical bars match the most frequent color(s) in the row of colored squares in the input grid.\n- The number of vertical bars matches the count of the most frequent color in the colored row.\n- If there are multiple colors with the same highest frequency, all are represented with vertical bars above their positions.\nSpeculation:\n","hint":"- situation: When the output grid preserves the structure or shape of the clusters found in the input but shows a change in color.\n  suggestion: Examine the spatial arrangement (for example, horizontal or vertical location) of each connected component in the input. Use metrics like the leftmost, rightmost, or centroid positions to decide how to reassign or recolor the regions in the output grid.\n- situation: When the output grid seems to be organized into rows and columns that may reflect the ordering of objects in the input.\n  suggestion: Look into whether the relative vertical and horizontal positions of the colored clusters in the input (for instance, leftmost objects mapping to the left column) determine their placement in the output grid. Mapping the spatial order of objects can help deduce row and column assignments.\n- situation: The output grid shows a new region filled with a color that does not appear in the input.\n  suggestion: Look for gaps between the anchor objects—whether vertical or horizontal. Investigate if the puzzle rule involves computing an inset area within the overall overlapping or intervening space between these anchors, then filling that area with the new color.\n- situation: When scattered nonzero pixels within a sub-region become consolidated into a uniform color in the output.\n  suggestion: Check for a dominant color or count if a particular color meets a threshold requirement in that region. If it does, try filling the whole sub-region with that color; if not, consider clearing the sub-region to the background.\n- situation: When the output exclusively features a subset of the colors present in the input, especially when one color seems to dominate the process.\n  suggestion: Identify the key color(s) driving the transformation and consider filtering or thresholding based on their presence. Analyze each region of the input to determine if the target color meets certain criteria (such as frequency or dominance) that maps to a specific output value."},"o4m_img":{"description":"# Observation Summary\nAcross all examples:\n- The 10×10 grid always has a horizontal white barrier at row 4, and only the top region (rows 0–3) and bottom row (row 9) contain non‐black pixels.\n- The input bottom row of colored pixels is preserved exactly in the output.\n- The number of vertical bars drawn above the barrier always equals the number of cyan markers in the input’s top row.\n- Each bar is one pixel wide, located in the same column as a cyan marker.\n- All bars in a single example share the same height, or each bar’s height seems to match the total count of cyan markers (e.g. three cm→3-pixel-tall bars, two cm→2-pixel tall bars, one cm→1-pixel tall bar).\n- The color of each bar corresponds to one of the colors in the bottom row, apparently taken from the input’s bottom‐row pixel that lies directly below that column.\n\n# Speculation\nHigh‐level rule: \n- For each cyan pixel in the topmost row of the input, draw a vertical bar above the white divider in the same column.\n- The height of each bar is equal to the total number of cyan pixels in the input.\n- The color of each drawn bar is taken from the input’s bottom row at that same column.","hint":"- situation: The grid contains a complete row of a single repeated color that clearly separates the grid into distinct horizontal zones.\n  suggestion: Consider treating the areas above and below such a barrier independently. Split the grid into regions based on the barrier and analyze each region separately for unique transformation behavior.\n- situation: When the grid contains a prominent, contiguous line or block of a specific color that spans a full row or column.\n  suggestion: Consider that this element may act as a divider, partitioning the grid into distinct zones. Investigate whether other elements are treated differently on either side of this divider.\n- situation: When there is a distinct region (or \"object\") whose position relative to a clear divider varies between input and output.\n  suggestion: Check if the region is being moved, flipped, or \"mirrored\" across the divider. Look for consistent shifts (e.g., moving from one side of the divider to the opposite side) that suggest a deliberate relocation.\n- situation: Only selected subregions (typically defined by the partitions) change between the input and output, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n  suggestion: Look for overlay steps where different regions are replaced by specific numbers. Try to identify which subregions correspond to which new values.\n- situation: When rows (or columns) contain clusters of non-background color separated by gaps (background zeros) and the output shows the same clusters intact while the gaps are consistently replaced with a new color.\n  suggestion: Consider that the key color regions might be acting as borders, and the transformation could be “filling in” the gaps between them with a new color. Analyze the spatial arrangement to decide if the rule is to preserve the border color and modify the gaps."}}}
